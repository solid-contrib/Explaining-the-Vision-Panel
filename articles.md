Simply put, Inrupt describes a Solid POD as being “like a secure USB stick for the Web, that you can access from anywhere."

Unless you know what Turtle, RDFLIB, Triples and Quads are, you’re not likely to get too far. That’s not a surprise since Solid is ultimately open source software to be used by engineers.
However, even some of the more pedestrian marketing descriptions can get a bit obtuse. For example, here’s how Inrupt explains a Solid POD:
Think of your Solid POD as your own private website, except that your data interoperates with all your apps, which means you have your own personal API to go along with it. When you post comments or videos online, your friends can view them with whatever app they like, such as an album viewer or a social feed. It’s your data, that can be shaped in any way or form.
You can have as many PODs as you like, and they live on Solid enabled Web servers. Install the Solid Server on your own server at your home or workplace, or Get a Solid POD from a listed provider."

* Mentions TBL 
* Now Sir Tim proposes a new protocol — Solid — whose goal is to reinvent the technological ecosystem to return information to the hands of users.
* Sir Tim pushes up the blackboard featuring the web as a meteor crashing back to earth. On the board below it, he starts drawing a set of cylinders. Solid is based around the idea of pods, personal data stores that could live in the cloud or which you could control directly. “Solid is web technology reapplied,” Sir Tim explains. “You use apps and web apps, but they don’t store your data at all….”
Sir Tim imagines uploading photos taken from a digital camera. The camera asks where you want to store the data. “You have a Solid pod at home, and one at work — you decide where to put them based on what context you want to use them in. Solid is a protocol, like the web. Pods are Solid-compatible personal clouds. Apps can talk to your pod.” So sharing photos is no longer about making LinkedIn and Flickr talk to each other — it’s simply about both of them talking to your pod, which you control.
* Solid, Inrupt, and “Pods”
* Storing data, saving data, isn’t rocket science. We can build a Solid compatible storage device and the apps can write any data they want onto it.
* But in a Solid world you can just put it out there. As a developer you don’t don’t have to worry about scaling the back end.
*  They will in future hopefully be doing things, in a Solid-compatible way, so that we’ll end up with a world of tremendous enablement of user choice, where you store the data, a market for apps for the data, which will become a commodity market but also a choice of high quality storage or local storage depending on what is you’re storing, and who you are, and what you can afford, and what your priorities are.

* metions Tim Berners-Lee

* The open project called Solid, by Inrupt and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, takes a similar approach: users can create what's called a "Solid POD" hosted on a server of their choosing (in essence, is their personal cloud) and plug it into an ecosystem of apps that access only the data they have permissions for. 
* The primary client/server protocol within those efforts is called ActivityPub, and it is accompanied by a number of other protocols for notification delivery, social data vocabulary, etc. Solid is using these protocols, and new products are emerging that also use them in their attempts to provide online social network experiences that are similar to existing platforms such as Twitter and YouTube.
* Personal data clouds like Solid PODs or Cozy aren't intended to provide a social networking product similar to Facebook or Twitter; instead, their goal is to provide a central, user-managed location for all of one's data, which can then be plugged into social products or platforms. 
* Solid
Kicked off by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and MIT in 2015, Solid is newer than Cozy. Its feature set is still nascent, and the UI leaves a lot to be desired, especially compared to Cozy. To be honest, in its current state, the UI is almost unusable. The Solid user guide on Github doesn't help much, and, at the time of publication, not all of the features covered in the guide were functional when you run a Solid server locally or with a Docker image in the cloud.
* However, whereas Cozy is user-focused, Solid is technology-focused. Solid's vision is that every person has a personal API on top of their personal cloud (called a POD in Solid parlance), and that API uses linked data and open standards for data exchange.
* While full functionality and standards adoption is far out, Solid is on the path to interoperability and decentralization by making linked data and RDF (both of which are integral to the Semantic Web) its foundation. Solid is still very much under development. But it has the most potential to be the de facto personal data cloud provider for a decentralized web.

Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance — by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way.”
— Tim Berners-Lee in his blog announcing Solid
It’s worth noting that Solid is a platform built using the existing web. The SAFE Network is a different story. This might well be ‘a’ version of the new internet we’ve been envisaging. Check it out!

* And, that is just what he is doing with Solid, Inrupt’s first product.
Solid is a technology, nearly 15-years in the making, that strives to give users control of their identity and data.
But to understand Solid you have to go back to the original prototype for the web browser, Mosaic. (I was tinkering with this new exciting tool in the CS undergraduate labs at Cornell. Uh-oh! I just dated myself.)
* Solid does not use a decentralized blockchain for its identity system. Solid uses what are called PODs.
* This Solid POD can be in your house or workplace, or with an online Solid POD provider of your choice. Since you own your data, you’re free to move it at any time, without interruption of service. You give people and your apps permission to read or write to parts of your Solid POD.

* Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the world wide web, has also been working on a way to shift the power from organizations and institutions back to citizens and consumers. The platform, Solid, offers users the opportunity to be in charge of where they store their data and who can access it. It is a form of re-decentralization. The Solid POD (Personal Online Data storage) is a secure place on a hosted server or the individual’s own server. Users can grant apps access to their POD as a person’s data is stored centrally and not by an app developer or on an organization’s server. We see this as potentially being a way to let people take back control from technology and other companies.

* Sir Tim’s current idea is a protocol – Solid – and a company – Inrupt – which want to make the Web as it is now significantly better. Just what are Solid and Inrupt? That’s what a smattering of us are here to find.
* Sir Tim pushes up the blackboard featuring the web as a meteor crashing back to earth. On the board below it, he starts drawing a set of cylinders. Solid is based around the idea of pods, personal data stores that could live in the cloud or which you could control directly. “Solid is web technology reapplied,” Sir Tim explains. “You use apps and web apps, but they don’t store your data at all.”Returning to his photo sharing scenario, Sir Tim imagines uploading photos taken from a digital camera. The camera asks where you want to store the data. “You have a Solid pod at home, and one at work – you decide where to put them based on what context you want to use them in. Solid is a protocol, like the web. Pods are Solid-compatible personal clouds. Apps can talk to your pod.” So sharing photos is no longer about making LinkedIn and Flickr talk to each other – it’s simply about both of them talking to your pod, which you control.

It can be payment and banking data, medical data, photos, calendars, documents — the list goes on and on and varies in specific composition from consumer to consumer.The Solid protocol, Berners-Lee explained to Webster, is “indifferent” to what type of data one wants to store there — it creates the common digital home where it can all live.

* Solid is working on developing so-called pods. You can think of pods as personal data vaults, keeping all your data in one place. From there, you can authorize applications to use the data, giving read or write access to your pod. And pods could be hosted on your own machine, or in the cloud. 
* But Solid has an ace up its sleeve there: knowledge graphs. 
* Solid is based on this technology, effectively aiming to build a personal knowledge graph for each of its users. Needless to say, this is quite ambitious, which may help explain why there is still no production-ready software for Solid. 
* It looks like the Solid team has the mindset and the people to make it work, while the tech is work in progress. Ruben Verborgh, Semantic Web professor, researcher, and Inrupt technology advocate, together with his team have been working on enriching the Linked Data stack with tools to address modern developers. 
* Their tools are based on JavaScript and frameworks such as React, and aim to make programming Solid a seamless experience. Verborgh and team are trying to meet developers where they are. Rather than expecting developers to switch to the Linked Data stack, they are giving them tools to build applications on Solid. This is smart, pragmatic, and a bit ironic, considering React's origins in Facebook. But will it work?

* It sounds great, but it’s tricky. Besides all the non-technical reasons, there are technical obstacles, too.

* Getting to the hearts and minds of developers is key to the success of Solid, as much as it is for any other software project today. Getting Solid in production-ready shape, and building applications on top of it, largely depends on it. Attracting developers is a fine art. Deep pockets, which we don’t know whether Solid has, is a good starting point, but it does not necessarily guarantee success.
* But just think of the possibilities that open up by putting the Fediverse and Solid together. This could be the key to social networking minus the dictator in the middle, data sovereignty, and a whole new ecosystem of innovation. Let’s hope Solid really gets solid soon.

* On the other hand, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, is developing Solid (Social Linked Data), through which he seeks to decouple data from the applications that silo it today. If he succeeds, data will be stored and managed by the people who produce it, and applications will compete based how they visualize the data and enhance user experience, not on their data hoarding capacity. An effective implementation would make platform neutrality less of a challenge: Switching between applications would be simple, since all the data they relied on is standardized across applications, and stored by ourselves. You can plug it into another application and move on as quickly you as you switch between tabs on a browser.

* The main concept of the Solid platform is the use of Solid PODs, which provide personal online data storage. The idea of Solid is that a user has one or more PODs to store their data and different apps are able to interact with these PODs, but these apps can only read and write the data to which the user has granted them access. So, instead of having to store all data of all users on a single server per app, users now **store and control** (!) their own data, leading to a decentralized approach. The focus of this blog post is on the interaction between the app and the Solid PODs.

The Solid network is fully conceptualized around these Pods that contain all the data of one person, whether it be your bank account or latest social posts. In this case, the data referring to you is fully owned by you. Both Inrupt and people within the Solid Community provide Pods that run on their respective servers, but you can also create your own Pod on your own server for ultimate privacy. There is **no central owner** of these Pods since this would undermine the Solid principal.

* Tim has created an open-source platform called Solid (Socially Linked Data) which he hopes will remedy this problem. Solid is designed to allow individuals and organisations store their data in PODS (personal online data stores) which can either be self-hosted or stored publicly in a cloud. Ultimately, apps only have access to a POD when an owner grants them access to it. Developers can also create apps on the platform “without harvesting massive amounts of data first”. Last year, Solid opened up its platform to developers to build apps on it through another platform, Inrupt, which he created to help fuel the growth of Solid.

* The Solid network is fully conceptualised around these Pods that contain all the data of one person, whether it be your bank-account or latest social posts. 
* And similarly, revoking access to the data is just as easy to accomplish. Solid might, therefore, be a possible answer to the growing need for privacy regulations within the internet. 
* With Solid and Pods, all services, from your favourite taxi company to your insurance company, would communicate through one API with your personal data. Each having separate read and write access to different parts of that data whilst reading and writing simultaneously.

Linked Data is a key element of Solid, and Verborgh is a key contributor to Linked Data research and implementation. At the Web's 30th anniversary, this is more relevant than ever.
* Solid is a new ecosystem for the Web, in which people store their own data instead of having to upload it to applications. This changes how we will build apps: we no longer have to harvest people's data, but ask permission to access people's data space.

* Berners-Lee was honored for his new startup inrupt, which emerged out of work at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developing the open-data platform Solid.
Solid aims to give users ownership over their data by building decentralized social applications.
"Right now we really have the worst of all worlds, in which people not only cannot control their data, but also can’t really use it, because it’s spread across a number of different silo-ed websites,” says Berners-Lee. “Our goal is to ‘re-decentralize the web’ and develop a web architecture that gives users more control over the information they provide to applications.”
Solid has produced some 50,000 so-called personal online data stores (PODs) that are being experimented on by thousands of developers across more than 25 countries. His company is also collaborating with partners like UK’s National Health Service to explore growing the scale of Solid, and intends to launch a user product by the end of the year.

*  " By designing the world wide web three decades ago, Sir Tim cemented himself as one of the most influential people of the modern era: his creation has had an incalculable impact on our everyday lives. But having grown increasingly concerned at how large interests were exploiting the web’s openness — including for electoral manipulation and cyber crime — the British computer scientist designed a data platform called Solid aimed at returning ownership of data to the users who generate it. In 2018, Sir Tim launched Inrupt, a for-profit company intended to put Solid into operation, maximising the upsides of the web while minimising its downsides. The goal, in Sir Tim’s words, is to “give people complete control of their data”."

* Mentions tech giants 
* Since 2015, he has been working on a new web infrastructure called Solid, or SOcial LInked Data, which rethinks how websites treat personal data. This is just one of a number of decentralised platforms that have emerged as a reaction to the internet’s current data-handling methods, but the backing of the founder of the web certainly makes Solid stand out from the crowd.
* Rather than companies such as Facebook and Google having the ability to store and share user data, Solid proposes separating websites from the data generated when users interact with them. A website running using Solid would allow users to decide where their data is stored instead of companies owning it. 
* Believing that it is “defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30 [years]”, Berners-Lee is optimistic that Solid could change the web for the better. But is this too good to be true?
* The introduction of GDPR last year demonstrated that legislative change can go some way to limiting the data practices of organisations, if building web apps on decentralised platforms such as Solid became law, then Berners-Lee’s vision for a “re-decentralised” web has a chance of taking off.

* Mentions Tim BL 
* In September of last year, Berners-Lee announced he would be taking a sabbatical from MIT to launch a new online platform, dubbed Solid, which could drastically reorient the current power structure of the internet and return control of user data to the users themselves.
* "Solid changes the current model where users have to hand over personal data to digital giants in exchange for perceived value," he explained. "As we've all discovered, this hasn't been in our best interests." Rather than have all of your online data concentrated in the hands of a few massive firms, Solid would effectively decentralize the way data is shared over the internet.
* To help drive adoption of Solid, Berners-Lee also announced the launch of Inrupt, his first commercial venture leveraging the new platform. As he explained to Fast Company, Solid would function like "a mashup of Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Spotify, and WhatsApp." But since any data generated on or imported to Solid would be stored in the user's secure personal online data (POD) locker, rather than being shunted across the internet, people would be able to entrust their most sensitive information (such as medical or financial records) to their apps, knowing that the data won't be misused.

The idea of Solid is that a user has one or more PODs to store their data and different apps are able to interact with these PODs, but these apps can only read and write the data to which the user has granted them access.

* "In Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent conversation with Harvard Law School's Jonathan Zittrain, the two briefly touched on a fascinating idea by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, to build **a protocol called Solid**.Solid would act as a kind of data locker that would allow web users complete control over their data and what websites, companies, and apps they shared it with. In a September 2018 Medium post, Berners-Lee explained:It gives every user a choice about where data is stored, which specific people and groups can access select elements, and which apps you use. It allows you, your family and colleagues, to link and share data with anyone. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time. Solid would allow users constant access to the data they share as well as the ability to pick and choose what which apps can access certain information."
* "If Solid could find a way to keep data secure from hackers and ensure that no one would ever be forced to hand over their data, we’d would likely have a good start to a new era of keeping our data safe on the Internet."

* The issue of decentralization came up when Professor Zittrain asked Zuckerberg his thoughts on Solid, a new project led by Professor Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, that is focused on the idea of "true data ownership." Under this protocol, user data is decoupled from apps and held in some kind of "locker" that is under the user's control, which means the user controls who can access this data and also the user is able to avoid the problem of vendor lock-in.

* His new project, Solid, aims to put **control over data back into the hands of users**.
* The **ecosystem** of Solid is based on the concept of PODs, which are spaces where an individual can keep all of their data, explained Jonathan Bingham, President and CEO of Janeiro Digital, a company that is working on the Solid **technology**. 
* According to Solid’s website, PODs are like “secure USB sticks for the Web, that you can access from anywhere.

* "The Web’s inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee (or “TBL”), is working on a thing he calls Solid, which I recently described.

* "Called Solid, it is **based around personal online data stores, or Pods, that contain the wealth of information people generate, and are their exclusive property**. This means they can allow access to particular elements of their data from particular services as they see fit, and move their data from app to app instead of surrendering it (imagine, for example, being able to move between social networks, taking your lists of friends and followers with you). Berners-Lee and his people are also working on a new kind of digital assistant they have named Charlie, the raison d’être of which is the careful use of personal information, to make individual lives easier and better, rather than the idea of using it to sell us things (“Charlie works for you; Charlie doesn’t work for Google or Amazon”)."
