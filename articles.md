* "Another prominent **architectural effort** called Solid is a **platform** championed by Tim Berners-Lee, one of the inventors of the world wide web." 
* "Solid specifically seeks to resolve trust deficits with regards to **data ownership**."
* "Applications built on top of the **open source** architecture will give individuals, rather than corporations, full control of their data."
* "Similar to **blockchain** initiatives, Solid is treating trust as a systems property, rather than an asset of individual organisations."
* "As an **open-source** architecture, Solid could both help big businesses strengthen stakeholder trust and serve as launch pad for start-up business and operating models that advance a more inclusive digital economy."
* "While technologies such as blockchain or Solid are powerful devices in the toolbox of leaders, they are not sufficient for building new architectures of trust."

* "Their vision for Inrupt is to decentralize the web through the company's **proprietary open-source platform** 'Solid', which allows users to store their own data - photos, comments, contacts, calendar events etc. - in their own personal Solid POD. Individuals can then give people and their apps permission to read or write to parts of their Solid POD, so that they never have to fill out their details again."

* "His current work on project Solid is to create **a word wide identity that is agnostic to provider**. Professor Berners-Lee explained that with no working global access control, the web created silos. The Solid web decentralisation project will give everybody one or more IDs, and you as the user will always own your IDs and your data."

* metions Tim Berners-Lee 
* mentions Facebook/ Google/ Microsoft/ big tech
* "In fact, Berners-Lee is fighting the battle for online privacy and liberty in at least two important ways. Besides leading the nonprofit World Wide Web Foundation which has launched a “Contract for the Web” initiative to put forth a Bill of Rights for the Web to clearly define users’ rights, he has also privately helped launch a company called **Inrupt which is developing a protocol** called Solid that would allow users to **protect their POD (personal online data)** by placing those data in a secure container (a POD) that users can access by **verifying their identities.**"
* "We can still unlock the true promise of the web by decentralizing the power that’s currently centralized in the hands of a few. How? By using the power of Solid. Solid is the technically potent **open-source platform** built to decentralize the Web. Inrupt is the company that’s helping to fuel Solid’s success.”" 
* "The revolution to shape Web 3.0 has begun and there appears to be a good chance that while it will be built on newer and better tech than Web 2.0, it may well have the privacy-oriented and freedom-oriented values of Web 1.0 — especially if platforms such as Inrupt’s Solid and Chaum’s Elixxir help shape it."
* "The real value of Solid and Elixxer cannot be understood without understanding the value of **protocols**."
* "As a result of the nature of **the Solid protocol**, applications written using it would all allow users to maintain control of their data even while posting pictures and other content to social media sites, so long as those sites adhered to the protocol."

* "Berners-Lee isn’t limiting himself to proclamations; since 2015, he’s been working on an **open-source decentralized web platform** called Solid, which has the lofty mission “to reshape the web as we know it.” The Solid model sees users storing their personal data in a “personal online data store” (POD) on a Solid server, providing permissioned access to companies and services, with the aim of “ **[restoring] rightful ownership of data** back to every web user.” Together with cybersecurity entrepreneur John Bruce, Berners-Lee has founded Inrupt, a start-up to foster development on the Solid platform, initially by hosting PODs."

* "The big data revolution has given immense value to data once thought to be worthless, but this has not always been for the better, according to Solid contributor and professor of decentralised web technology at Ghent University, Ruben Verborgh."
* "The idea behind Solid (for Social Linked Data), the project started by Tim Berners-Lee, is to **decouple data from applications and allow individuals and companies to store data such as blogs, posts, contact details, emails, likes, comments and whatever else in their own encrypted ‘pods' (personal online data stores) hosted wherever they see fit**. They can then **grant or deny access to that data to applications that want to use it**. Solid is a big part of Berners-Lee's efforts to 'redecentralise the web'."
* "With the **Solid model**, applications become views over data rather than ingesters of it, the idea being that software companies will then compete on services provided rather than on data accrued. This depends on opening up the data silos and proprietary formats and making data interoperable."

Indeed, he is working on Solid, **a project designed to allow individuals to manage their personal data** and that resulting from their online interactions in their own stores, outside of the corporate walled gardens. Solid was launched with some fanfare last year by Berners-Lee and Inrupt, a startup created to commercialise the project."

SoLiD seeks to simplify **data ownership** concerns for consumers and businesses by 1) giving users the **freedom to take their data anywhere** and **avoid vendor lock-in**, and 2) for developers, the ability to **reuse data** in existing apps for new apps so consumer data does not need to be shared with a new service.³⁵^⁴¹^⁴²
In SoLiD, **PDSs are called pods, and pods are stored on SoLiD servers.** ⁴³
SoLiD utilizes Linked Data, a way of connecting resources throughout the web by having a uniform resource location (URL) for each piece of data, and explicitly stating how each piece of data is related to each other.⁴¹^⁴²"

2019-08-08 [Innovation Excellence: Inventor of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, Has Launched a New Startup](https://www.innovationexcellence.com/blog/2019/08/08/inventor-of-the-web-tim-berners-lee-has-launched-a-new-startup/)
* "The foundation of Inrupt’s solution is an **open source platform** called Solid, which can be used by web developers to create applications that use data which is stored in PODs. Simply put, Inrupt describes a Solid POD as being “like a secure USB stick for the Web, that you can access from anywhere."
* "Reading through Inrupt’s literature it’s not entirely clear how all of this will be managed; partly because the info available on Solid is clearly intended for developers. Unless you know what Turtle, RDFLIB, Triples and Quads are, you’re not likely to get too far. That’s not a surprise since Solid is ultimately open source software to be used by engineers.
However, even some of the more pedestrian marketing descriptions can get a bit obtuse. For example, here’s how Inrupt explains a Solid POD:
Think of your Solid POD as your own private website, except that your data interoperates with all your apps, which means you have your own personal API to go along with it. When you post comments or videos online, your friends can view them with whatever app they like, such as an album viewer or a social feed. It’s your data, that can be shaped in any way or form.
You can have as many PODs as you like, and they live on Solid enabled Web servers. Install the Solid Server on your own server at your home or workplace, or Get a Solid POD from a listed provider."

* Data sovereignty is precisely the vision behind Solid, the application development framework championed by Tim Berners Lee. Berners Lee, credited as the inventor of the web, is working on Solid with the help of startup Inrupt, and contributors from the open source and research community.
* Solid is working on developing so-called pods. You can think of pods as personal data vaults, keeping all your data in one place. From there, you can authorize applications to use the data, giving read or write access to your pod. And pods could be hosted on your own machine, or in the cloud.
* It sounds great, but it’s tricky. Besides all the non-technical reasons, there are technical obstacles, too. If this caught up, it would mean applications would have to fetch data from pods all over the web and the cloud to work. Querying in distributed environments is notoriously hard. But Solid has an ace up its sleeve there: knowledge graphs. 
* Solid is based on this technology, effectively aiming to build a personal knowledge graph for each of its users. Needless to say, this is quite ambitious, which may help explain why there is still no production-ready software for Solid.
* It looks like the Solid team has the mindset and the people to make it work, while the tech is work in progress. 
* Their tools are based on JavaScript and frameworks such as React, and aim to make programming Solid a seamless experience
* Rather than expecting developers to switch to the Linked Data stack, they are giving them tools to build applications on Solid.
* Getting to the hearts and minds of developers is key to the success of Solid, as much as it is for any other software project today. Getting Solid in production-ready shape, and building applications on top of it, largely depends on it. Attracting developers is a fine art. Deep pockets, which we don’t know whether Solid has, is a good starting point, but it does not necessarily guarantee success.
* But just think of the possibilities that open up by putting the Fediverse and Solid together. This could be the key to social networking minus the dictator in the middle, data sovereignty, and a whole new ecosystem of innovation. Let’s hope Solid really gets solid soon.

* Berners-Lee is also working on a project called SOLID (an acronym for Social Linked Data). The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.
* Imagine having the right to control your data. Social media giants will not get to run algorithms on it,” explained the scientist, adding that in principle this is what the GDPR is all about, but SOLID offers the technology to do this.

* Today, Berners-Lee champions a new platform called Solid (which we've written about before) which aims to give us back control of our personal data.
* "The Solid program at MIT is about turning the way the web works upside-down," said Berners-Lee. "It's about **separating the apps from the data**. So, when you go to an app the app says to you 'Where do you want to save your data?'".
* Extrapolate that to the web, where the data and apps could be run anywhere and you have an approximation of how Solid works.
* At its heart, Solid is a way of managing federated identity. Everyone with Solid has their own identifier, which looks like a URL, that makes it easy to share information.
* But imagine if those apps kept their data in repositories - Pods in Solid-speak - that you control. That's what Solid promises.

The main concept of the Solid platform is the use of Solid PODs, which provide personal online data storage. The idea of Solid is that a user has one or more PODs to store their data and different apps are able to interact with these PODs, but these apps can only read and write the data to which the user has granted them access.

But its idea is allowing people to have the data that they generate as they motor around the web end up in their own kind of **data locker**. Now, for somebody like Tim, it might mean literally in a locker under his desk and he could wake up in the middle of the night and see where his data is. For others, it might mean Iraq somewhere, guarded perhaps by a fiduciary who’s looking out for them, the way that we put money in a bank and then we can sleep at night knowing the bankers are– this is maybe not the best analogy in 2019, but watching.

Mark Zuckerberg: We’ll get there.

Jonathan Zittrain: We’ll get there. But Solid says if you did that, people would then– or their helpful proxies– be able to say, “All right, Facebook is coming along.

* "In Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent conversation with Harvard Law School's Jonathan Zittrain, the two briefly touched on a fascinating idea by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, to build **a protocol called Solid**.Solid would act as a kind of data locker that would allow web users complete control over their data and what websites, companies, and apps they shared it with. In a September 2018 Medium post, Berners-Lee explained:It gives every user a choice about where data is stored, which specific people and groups can access select elements, and which apps you use. It allows you, your family and colleagues, to link and share data with anyone. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time. Solid would allow users constant access to the data they share as well as the ability to pick and choose what which apps can access certain information."
* "If Solid could find a way to keep data secure from hackers and ensure that no one would ever be forced to hand over their data, we’d would likely have a good start to a new era of keeping our data safe on the Internet."

* The issue of decentralization came up when Professor Zittrain asked Zuckerberg his thoughts on Solid, a new project led by Professor Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, that is focused on the idea of "true data ownership." Under this protocol, user data is decoupled from apps and held in some kind of "locker" that is under the user's control, which means the user controls who can access this data and also the user is able to avoid the problem of vendor lock-in.

This means they can allow access to particular elements of their data from particular services as they see fit, and move their data from app to app instead of surrendering it (imagine, for example, being able to move between social networks, taking your lists of friends and followers with you). Berners-Lee and his people are also working on a new kind of digital assistant they have named Charlie, the raison d’être of which is the careful use of personal information, to make individual lives easier and better, rather than the idea of using it to sell us things (“Charlie works for you; Charlie doesn’t work for Google or Amazon”)."
