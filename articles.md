2019-11-20 [LSE Business Review: How to turn trust into a competitive advantage](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2019/11/20/how-to-turn-trust-into-a-competitive-advantage/) 
* metions Tim Berners-Lee 
* mentions Facebook/ Google/ Microsoft/ big tech
* "Another prominent **architectural effort** called Solid is a **platform** championed by Tim Berners-Lee, one of the inventors of the world wide web." 
* "Solid specifically seeks to resolve trust deficits with regards to **data ownership**."
* "Applications built on top of the **open source** architecture will give individuals, rather than corporations, full control of their data."
* "Similar to **blockchain** initiatives, Solid is treating trust as a systems property, rather than an asset of individual organisations."
* "As an **open-source** architecture, Solid could both help big businesses strengthen stakeholder trust and serve as launch pad for start-up business and operating models that advance a more inclusive digital economy."
* "While technologies such as blockchain or Solid are powerful devices in the toolbox of leaders, they are not sufficient for building new architectures of trust."

* "Their vision for Inrupt is to decentralize the web through the company's **proprietary open-source platform** 'Solid', which allows users to store their own data - photos, comments, contacts, calendar events etc. - in their own personal Solid POD. Individuals can then give people and their apps permission to read or write to parts of their Solid POD, so that they never have to fill out their details again."
