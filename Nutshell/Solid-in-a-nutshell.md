# Solid in a Nutshell

Solid is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along. 

Where a user stores their data is called a Pod. Pods are always separate from apps. Pods can either be provided or users can self-host their own Pod(s). One user can have multiple Pods. Multiple apps can use the same data.

Users can have more than one identity which can either be from an identity provider or from a domain that the user owns. Regardless of the identity provider, users can share data with each other. 

## Beneficent Apps and Pods 
Some Solid apps and Pods will be branded as 'beneficent' which will use data in the interest of the user (without advertising). Users will pay for beneficent apps and Pods.
