“In Solid, it doesn’t matter if somebody has got their account from Dropbox, or from Google or Facebook or inrupt.net or solid.community, whatever service provider they got their account with you can put them in the access control list. So you can drag their ID. So I can have just one professional ID. You can all take photographs of this conference and you can then put them in a folder, on a Solid server, and you can use it, and the access control on the Solid server can give me access to it once you know my ID you can drag in all kinds of people by their ID no matter where they are no matter who hosts their ID. You can also create a group and you can put people in the group.”

So what we said is the basic sorts of things that you do within Dropbox or within Facebook or with Google. Those become first class objects, those are standardised. In Solid, all of the servers need to understand access control. Once I’ve done that, once I’ve shared my ID I can build apps to do whatever I like. So we’ve got apps running our lives, we’ve got chat apps for example. So in Solid you can chat about anything, you can create a meeting, you can chat about the meeting, you can have a meeting about the chat, you can create a to-do list you can create an issue tracker.

All these things you can just store it and when you start the app you can just be asked where you want it stored.

And you can have many storage places, we call them Pods, so you can have many Pods.  I have one at home on my computer. I’m a geek, I so I’ve installed the Solid server on a mac mini which is sitting at home because I can and I back it up to the cloud as a backup. Some people do that but most people just get accounts at different storage providers.

But the crucial thing about Solid is that we’ve separated the apps from the data storage so that you can use different apps on the same data. 

You can use one photo manager library app to manage a slide show of the vacation and your family can be using completely difference library photos apps. So using open source here is really cool because there will be commercial versions but at the moment most of this stuff is open source. So if you’re a developer and your using this photo library and you’re looking through the photo slide show and I think yea but I want, this slide doesn’t even go backwards, how come it doesn’t go backwards? That’s crazy, I want the slide show to go backwards. Oh there we are, fork it on github. So we live in a world of github now. Well, I dunno maybe you other ones.  Other systems. GitLab and so on but. And it’s true that GitHub is a dominant central repository and in a perfect decentralised world as we decentralise the web we shouldn’t all be using GitHub. But it is pretty nifty when you go to the Solid organisation and you can just look down the apps and pick one and you can fork it and make your own version. So if you want a pink one on a blue background you can do that. And it may be that your version with a pick background becomes more popular. Because it is interoperable with all the other photo managers out there it spreads because pink is the colour of 2019. So you release the code for your pink version of app and you think no more about it. Because the way Solid works is that the app is separate from the data. So people can set up apps to use your photo editor instead of the default one when people send the link to the photo or when they set their phone up.” 28:10
