## Question from audience

> Hi, first I first want to say thanks for your vague but interesting idea. I've got maybe a vague question of my own. Aactually really what you're just saying, so the web as it is now is designed for document the move them and we still talk about web documents. But so much of you know applications and things like that it's really data being delivered over the web but there's no interoperable you know Facebook has its standard for their data help all these companies have different ways of representing their data. 
>
> Are you aware of any standards that kind of hope to kind of unify this kind of data layer and how would you go about kind of promoting that you know given these ideas are really hard there's there's a million different ideas for doing this how do you standardize people on one?

### Tim's answer 

> Well the Solid project is exactly that. So github.com/solid. It's early days. So as a developer you do things link using turtle and drinking the linked data kool-aid because it's cool. And look at the Solid stuff, because the whole idea of that, there are two levels. 
>
> One is that that data stores have generic APIs. That is one layer of standardisation. You can tweak files you can add data, you can add facts to a file, you're reading and writing files, you're also editing files. That you can treat any file as a database basically. To be a Solid server you just need that level of standardisation. 
>
> But to make it all work the apps can write stuff in the storage. But they can't just write anything. You have to standardise how you store your contacts, how you store your friends, how you build the interactions. These aren't just pieces of data they are invitations and acceptances and things like that so we're working through that. 
>
> Do join us. I hereby encourage you, this is the best I can do.

```
        sweet hey thanks for inviting me thanks
00:04   everybody for coming this reads like the
00:07   Regis enterprising the web or that
00:09   decentralized where is is a topic dear
00:14   to my heart and it's great to have so
00:18   much energy when booster thoughts
00:20   anything a lot of energy goes over and
00:22   just from having Bruce to involve never
00:24   mind all the other people that you votes
00:25   in and we have a great crowd here today
00:28   is very exciting I'll so I suppose I'd
00:31   been asked to as well start just a
00:33   little bit touched back on the original
00:36   you know what it was like back then any
00:39   other lessons nope you're not you're not
00:43   but I'm not but neither are you a my
00:45   break maybe we could just turn the
00:47   projector alpha would be good lots of
00:50   housewives this is a very yellow
00:54   situation it's also a really interesting
00:56   cause religious sensation when you are
00:59   saying that it you worried about people
01:01   I think had weird dreams anybody who
01:04   just woke up here in a yellow light
01:07   filled church with sacred relics
01:10   containing all of human on knowledge at
01:13   the back of the room flashing lights
01:15   would definitely think they woken up in
01:17   some kind of sci fi re run or something
01:22   this is a very surreal so of a very
01:25   actually especially to be here in this
01:27   church of the church visual knowledge so
01:33   back then ok so when had done his work
01:37   thank you bobkona folks 20 years before
01:41   I did the web thing okay they did it 69
01:44   okay 89 no totally different music very
01:47   different situations it took 20 years
01:49   for the people in Europe to actually get
01:51   round to realizing that the internet
01:52   wasn't something was something they
01:54   could use even though they didn't matter
01:55   themselves and so it became politically
01:58   appropriate to use at CERN and the
02:00   connectivity which had was Matt Morris
02:02   throughout the US has actually
02:04   percolated through often through people
02:09   doing it kind of against the bots buses
02:11   bosses requests and actually running IP
02:14   packets over lines which had been lent
02:16   to them for other purposes quietly
02:18   tunneling and things but it was there
02:20   its own and I could use it and I had my
02:22   boss yeah that thought it was big be
02:26   exciting on that piece of paper which
02:27   turned out only after we are he died
02:30   unfortunately ten years later and they
02:32   found that in his blinds so at that
02:38   point the eye the objective was to make
02:42   something Universal my seen Larson also
02:44   people make really really cool
02:46   documentation systems which required you
02:48   to log into a particular system user
02:53   particular format using a particular
02:54   server user to get client user
02:57   particular word processor using plastic
02:59   or even use a particular structure like
03:01   some of them were free oriented some of
03:03   the matrix oriented and the people and
03:06   the guys who had matrix oriented mind
03:08   designed matrix oriented documentation
03:11   systems which you had to choose a sort
03:12   of a classification and the category and
03:15   the people who are tree aren't adjusted
03:16   rebelled and wouldn't use it so is this
03:18   constant rebellion of people refusing to
03:20   use documents and documentation control
03:23   systems and help systems so result was
03:25   at CERN which had lots of really cool
03:27   people there was this mass of
03:29   heterogeneity and yeah just stepping
03:32   back from it realizing actually all
03:34   these systems different though they were
03:35   they all could be viewed as just hyper
03:38   text pages and so in fact it would just
03:40   take a bit of code to put on to run on
03:42   those systems to convert them into
03:44   hyperx pages within this global sister
03:48   those they are of getting that actually
03:51   to take off I with tricky involved
03:55   making a lot of some oats and to an
03:58   extent a lot of compromises like the
04:02   data format HTML looked like sgml
04:06   particular HTML the way certain people
04:08   were using it the tag each one was
04:10   because the people I worked with were
04:12   used to riding each one of the front toe
04:14   in front of a heading and so they go
04:15   along with that they look at and say
04:17   yeah okay that's what you know HTML
04:19   humor whatever I can do that
04:20   and the ACPD language no so that it
04:24   seems angle back it's so why shouldn't
04:25   the network protocol use angle brackets
04:27   too well that's because the network
04:29   verticals didn't if you look but if you
04:31   looked at SN T P and n NT never news but
04:34   all existing protocols once it carried
04:37   mail and carried that hughesnet news for
04:40   those old enough to remember use that
04:43   news back then great system those
04:47   protocols all had a different way of
04:49   being read they had a sort of you know
04:52   an uppercase verb and in and the lines
04:57   and they sent for example things like
04:58   Mia messages around so HGB was just a
05:02   concoction of smtp and nntp with it and
05:06   so that when internet program is back
05:09   then looked at it they look today the
05:10   guy oh yeah I could do that yeah Alice's
05:12   that's what straightforward you're not
05:14   trying to pull at me pull me into some
05:16   weird weird space so all and the URL
05:19   there's thing I've had to have that we
05:21   call URLs now but they're called they
05:23   were using universal document identifies
05:25   back end and the in the the udi was
05:30   designed to look as much as possible
05:32   like a UNIX file a I must have met I had
05:35   no compunction at all about making the
05:39   slashes go the right original way even
05:41   though a lot of the world at that point
05:42   we're happy we're putting the man
05:44   backwards for reasons the historians
05:46   will just write books about our imagine
05:48   but so the sashes it was great to have
05:52   the source the the sash is going the
05:54   right way but then file names works were
05:56   good up to the point where you've got to
05:59   the root of your file of your computer
06:01   and then there was a question of what to
06:03   do about then the network piece of it
06:06   and the double slash actually came from
06:08   the palo domain system the apollo
06:10   domains folks had one local area network
06:13   you could address files and other
06:15   systems by putting a double slash
06:17   computer name so the idea was to get
06:19   anybody who'd seen it paulo domain says
06:21   term parent would use them so the lot of
06:25   the a lot of the web design was about
06:30   picking up things that people have
06:32   already used and
06:33   and putting them together so that people
06:35   wouldn't feel that it was strange I just
06:38   mentioned that's one of the things we
06:39   should kind of which is useful and if we
06:42   can over then build new systems but you
06:44   sisters together would have to probably
06:45   use dassel technique incremental change
06:48   only change the piece says that we need
06:51   but then you know then what happened was
06:54   the thing to actually did take off it
06:56   was never clear that he was going to
06:58   take off now people are very few minutes
07:01   a done deal but still you have to be
07:02   careful the ways it can still fail but
07:06   when it took off to so then to rewind
07:09   you back the first you know first 5-10
07:11   years of the web then there was a sort
07:15   of a sudden sort of euphoria about
07:18   breaking down those boundaries but
07:20   internet was designed without the nation
07:23   being a concept so in fact it's it's
07:26   difficult if you can find out where a
07:29   web view the work user of your website
07:31   is but you have to take effort it's not
07:32   obvious though so that the internet
07:35   packets by default cross boundaries so
07:38   this thing he was a space which was
07:40   different from nations here was his
07:43   space a lot of people like John Perry
07:45   Barlow and people wrote about oh you
07:48   know cyberspace is new and different and
07:50   we can do everything right in cyberspace
07:51   and we can all be you know we it can be
07:54   one big hippie encampment or it can be
07:56   one big communist regime or it can be
07:59   one big buddy but everybody felt that it
08:02   would be one big and the and they got
08:05   very excited about the fact that anybody
08:07   could make a blog anybody could make a
08:09   website and then your website would be
08:12   making some files putting them on your
08:14   computer downloading the ATP demon and
08:16   running on your computer and plugging
08:18   your computer into the internet and then
08:19   bingo you were a publisher and the fact
08:23   that anybody could publish I think
08:25   everybody felt that was really really
08:26   that was nifty to the extent that he was
08:29   going to completely change society it
08:31   was going of someone who's going to be a
08:33   big level though culturally everybody
08:35   would be I'll put their ideas out there
08:36   and by just linking to in your blog to
08:40   the blogs of other people you respected
08:42   we would end up creating a web of really
08:45   intelligent
08:46   a discussion which would address all the
08:49   issues and resolve all the problems of
08:51   the day and and certain so and the so
08:59   and then the years that followed we have
09:03   quietly moved on lard and wonderful
09:07   things to be known and the creativity
09:09   that people put into building on top of
09:11   the web platform has been wonderful the
09:14   course that you know the whole idea of a
09:15   platform the internet was a platform the
09:18   great thing about when men to the
09:19   platform we didn't I think about good
09:21   thing about platform doesn't have
09:22   attitude it didn't have any attitude
09:23   about what you should use it for
09:24   similarly the where got no attitude
09:27   about what you should use it for and
09:28   therefore no constraints and what use it
09:30   for it's universal you can do whatever
09:32   you like and therefore massive amount of
09:33   creativity and innovation and the treaty
09:36   and innovation bow has produced one of
09:38   the things like very powerful social
09:40   networks where people spend a lot of
09:42   their time and tell recently but miss
09:45   Elise in the last few years about five
09:48   years not two years particularly people
09:53   have been coming up to me and I realized
09:56   that out there there's a sort of a
09:58   unease there's nannies because there's
10:01   people thinking we remember that ah that
10:04   that utopian are leveling of society and
10:08   that reinvention of our systems of
10:10   governance and our systems of debate ah
10:14   what happen to that and the answer is
10:16   well the people that I thought you know
10:18   we hoped will be making their own
10:20   websites and we imagined fanciful you
10:22   know putting them on the computer
10:23   sitting under the TV actually no you
10:25   actually they'll just on one great big
10:27   website and it turns out that when you
10:29   talk to them they're quite frustrated
10:31   because you thought you find a typical
10:32   day in the life of a person out there if
10:38   they're there they have their friends on
10:39   Facebook and they have some photos on
10:42   Flickr and they have their colleagues
10:45   are all on linkedin and they then all
10:49   they want to do is they've uploaded some
10:51   photos to flickr and they just want to
10:54   share those photos with their colleagues
10:56   on linkedin and with their friends who
10:59   we happen to be on facebook and you know
11:01   what take out and you know and that's
11:05   really when you look at it it's really
11:07   stupid but if you know if you in this
11:08   world of course now you have to either
11:10   tell flickr about all your friends and
11:12   all your colleagues or you have to move
11:14   the photos onto facebook or you have to
11:17   or you have to build a you have to move
11:22   your photos onto a linkedin and
11:23   separately and send them out separately
11:24   or you can build a third application and
11:28   get and run it and get it or get it the
11:31   right to extract the list of friends
11:33   from Facebook good you can try to build
11:35   a third application which will will
11:37   build a bridge between those two but
11:39   then you have to learn if you're a
11:40   developer you have to learn Facebook API
11:41   you have to learn the LinkedIn API you
11:43   have to the flickr api and you know what
11:46   you lost i'll just mail unto them that
11:48   are the stamp on it because this all my
11:53   life has been stuck in these silos so
11:57   the silo ization of the web is what
12:00   people are subtly finding so I starting
12:03   it wrecked against it was a great car if
12:05   I had one side it would be the cartoon
12:06   look from the ax-cut the economists did
12:08   several years ago now about of people
12:11   that the this showing how like prison
12:16   cells the the world has got these walls
12:18   and when you're in one social network
12:21   was really hard to get into the other
12:23   one of people walking on top of the
12:24   walls trying to hold help her friends up
12:26   and over into the next social so that
12:29   the social networking site great cartoon
12:30   so so they here we are a situation where
12:37   the internet was designed to be
12:38   basically decentralized we can talk
12:40   about that detail and Vince gone into
12:43   some of the issues I wordiness and the
12:46   web was designed to be decentralized so
12:47   everybody can I make that everyone could
12:49   be everybody we could participate by
12:51   having their own domain and having their
12:53   own web server around this wasn't out
12:55   and in fact we've got the situation
12:56   where individual personal data Anna was
13:00   has been locked up in these silos and
13:04   there is one of the features of the last
13:07   few years is that if you read the trade
13:09   press
13:12   you read magazines what the first thing
13:15   you'd get of the top of a lot of the
13:17   articles and certainly anything in the
13:19   in the marketing world is you get the
13:23   assumption they say well what the world
13:25   today is one where the consumer gets a
13:30   whole lot of things for free and a deal
13:33   that consumer has done is that they sold
13:35   their soul of their privacy too in all
13:40   together things for free and whatever
13:43   when they sell it when they a way to
13:45   give a give away the privacy to the
13:47   thing the machine to the marketing
13:50   systems whoever it is that eventually
13:51   gets the data that has been captured by
13:54   you and in all these many ways and what
13:59   happens to that allows them to suddenly
14:01   get targeted with all kinds of things
14:03   becomes impossible to not that let that
14:06   person not that you not know that you're
14:09   pregnant so you end up getting and your
14:11   child ends up getting things for the
14:12   rest of their life knowing from just
14:16   when you're buying patterns switch from
14:20   going out a lot eating to buying diapers
14:22   or by buying you buy the first crib
14:25   because the system actually makes a huge
14:27   amount of use of that data which people
14:29   find the family a little bit creepy but
14:30   an assumption is that but yeah
14:33   everybody's happy with that that is the
14:35   deal you're not totally happy with that
14:37   but you know they're so happy to get
14:39   searched for free and use of free that
14:42   that's and that's and that's how it
14:46   works and the only way to make
14:48   advertising on at the moment you know is
14:50   by it makes me money is to make is to
14:53   advertising so what's wrong with this
14:56   picture what's wrong with this picture
14:58   is that well I think start with that
15:03   hold the deal that the deal that
15:05   consumer gone through I put it to you
15:07   it's a myth it's a myth that it has to
15:11   be I think it's a myth that everybody's
15:13   happy with it and I think it's a myth
15:15   that it's optimal so in fact what's
15:19   weird about it is if you think of me as
15:20   a consumer right I've my data
15:24   go for a run I give her a run say using
15:27   some gadget and my gadget can be
15:29   communicates by Anto by bluetooth with
15:31   my laptop my natural Pablo's it to the
15:33   cloud and then that cloud knows all
15:35   about how well fast I ran today well you
15:39   know what value of that little piece of
15:41   data about how well I ran today is about
15:45   some guy with some demographic and it's
15:48   a little bit about how once some guy
15:49   with some in some particular demographic
15:51   is choosing to keep fit today for the
15:54   point of view of marketers it tells you
15:57   a little bit about about what I might
16:02   buy my shell Sammy want to sell me some
16:04   running shoes because you can figure out
16:05   maybe you could figure out by looking at
16:07   the phosphine I running that I probably
16:09   need some new shoes because I'm gay slow
16:11   because I'm limping up something by
16:12   liking at the GPS traces but you know
16:14   but basically hmm the actual value to
16:18   you the big marketing machine is
16:19   actually really really small compared
16:21   that actually from when you look in my
16:24   point of view that that day that's thing
16:27   about me okay so if I'm supposing I'm
16:31   running machine trying to track of my
16:32   life that data I put it to you that the
16:34   date the value the data to me is much
16:37   greater than the value later to anybody
16:39   else so not for bit well won't go for
16:48   questions for a bit yeah I know we have
16:50   to catch up sometime we didn't talk
16:51   about selling times any times so that
16:57   would give us half questions if we went
17:00   to questions out so the so so the
17:09   proposal is then to bring back the idea
17:13   of a decentralized where bring back
17:14   power to people there's the things we're
17:17   doing at MIT various other organizations
17:21   involve just breaking that model where
17:25   you all your data is in different silos
17:27   involves making where we have a project
17:30   for example which is called solid and it
17:35   which involves having a standard
17:38   that when when i get my fitbit data
17:43   whatever it is i can put it in my own
17:45   storage i can put it in cloud storage so
17:47   i control and so we are thinking we're
17:50   going to make a social revolution by
17:51   just tweaking we're going to use my
17:52   technology but we're going to use it in
17:54   a way that we can separate their apps
17:57   that you use from the data this use and
17:59   so that I can control my day to imagine
18:01   I have a place to keep up my data and
18:02   and so the whenever I run any app it
18:11   will store data in places like control
18:13   and as a result when I run something
18:15   like a lifestyle app it doesn't just get
18:17   access to the things in one silo like my
18:20   friends management app doesn't just get
18:24   access to the stuff in my facebook sido
18:26   gets access to my whole life and it go
18:29   and it can get access to the pieces of
18:31   other people's lives that I should have
18:33   happy to share with so that's the way in
18:35   which we're proposing you're tweaking
18:38   the architecture a little bit but
18:39   dramatically changing the way through
18:41   socially there are lots of other ways in
18:43   which now we've had the decentralized
18:45   interest group information group at MIT
18:48   for four years I've been talking about
18:50   reason really centralizing the web and
18:51   there's a redo centralized or all
18:55   movement which has had some meetings in
18:57   London this one then when you but when
19:00   you use the word decentralized you put
19:01   up a workshop then you meet all kinds of
19:03   interest and people who are looking at
19:05   issues looking at some of the issues for
19:08   example with the existing web design the
19:11   fact that we use domain names system
19:12   well you know it was there and it was
19:16   clear that it has issues as vince
19:20   mentioned one of the things we could do
19:22   is we could change the rules the domain
19:24   name system so we imagine we have a dot
19:26   archive and top-level domain where
19:29   actually you don't rent them you get
19:32   them forever and the deal is with if you
19:34   have anything and they put in the dollar
19:36   archive domain then it's out there to be
19:39   copied it's subject to these interesting
19:41   protocols and that the mainstays error
19:46   you don't like em you may not keep it
19:48   you may die but the mainstays
19:51   managed by somebody else and if nobody
19:52   nobody's using it actively then it'll
19:55   turn it'll just go into the system of
19:57   all the connected arc internet archives
20:00   in the world so there aren't things
20:04   though lots of also really cool systems
20:07   where you say NESN let's not use human
20:11   readable names which have semantics at
20:13   all because there's a kind of risky they
20:15   they people by the way people you should
20:20   think of the HTTP URL as a name not as a
20:23   location philosophically is a name it is
20:27   not a location the fact it's called a
20:30   URL was because of a battle I lost in
20:32   the ITF many years ago but you should
20:35   think about it as names and one of the
20:38   ways to move to get people out of the
20:40   thinking that these things are locations
20:41   which can change is to actually not use
20:44   a domain name at all but to just use say
20:46   a cryptographic hash of the actual text
20:53   of the thing which has interested also
20:56   interesting properties and other things
20:57   are you can generate a public/private
20:59   key pair for it and have it identified
21:01   by the public key when you keep the
21:02   private key that allows you to change it
21:05   and you can put the changes into the box
21:07   change if you believe or if you do
21:08   believe that the boxing isn't another
21:10   centralization that we're liable to fall
21:12   into if there's only just one boxing so
21:15   lots and lots are not around here the
21:17   lots lots lots of we've had some
21:19   discussion with NDP meeting yesterday
21:21   with some very very cool projects which
21:26   though I'm sure that will be available
21:28   in but the but i think the what we're
21:34   all aiming for is to make the web more
21:39   better in lots of ways more reliable
21:43   gibbets give the ability when you follow
21:46   a link already for example HTML you can
21:49   now run a little thing that's happened
21:52   on the site you can put a sub resource
21:54   integrity you could just mention here if
21:58   you are just saying that when you are
22:00   linking to something with HP or you can
22:02   actually give its hash as well so that's
22:04   no that's
22:05   talk to Wendy when it's down there
22:07   that's so new stands up from WTC which
22:11   are adding to the web as we know it that
22:14   the sort of the addressed by hash if you
22:19   i put the properties that a lot of you
22:21   have gotten you in these mike is called
22:23   decentralized systems so a lot of the
22:28   issues which we've been talking about we
22:29   will be talking about about naming about
22:32   should we fix dns i think a lot of
22:36   people feel that the squatting I know
22:38   when I've tried to have a really cool
22:40   project and I feel good and I've had
22:41   this name for it like when can we need
22:44   I'll get when could we meet calm and I
22:45   find everything like when community calm
22:47   has been bought by a speculator and has
22:50   Adele said to me four hundred thousand
22:51   dollars that is not very good for
22:53   innovation if there is one hundred
22:55   thousand dollars tax for having a good
22:57   idea which consists of several English
22:59   words so obviously say when can we not
23:02   and that's why the world is full of when
23:04   could we put them things out there it's
23:07   largely closed off speculation which
23:09   kind of sucks so the management of the
23:10   one possibilities we have new top-level
23:12   domains which we manage completely
23:14   differently we will find ways of ruling
23:16   out speculation another possible that
23:19   easily actually starts creating
23:22   replacing the use of the domain name
23:25   system by something else exciting times
23:28   exciting times any will end all end up
23:31   it's very important that we own that
23:33   producing standards of course one of the
23:35   some of the exciting debate is going to
23:38   be about about the way these different
23:40   projects can actually use different
23:41   piece of pieces of each other it's hard
23:45   to do that because involves constraining
23:47   the way you work to be able to in
23:49   compatible way somebody else works which
23:52   sucks because it's so much easier to
23:54   just go straight ahead and design your
23:56   own system without looking at either
23:57   side and in fact you always have to
23:59   catch it you have to hit them a happy
24:02   medium other things that go by the way
24:06   you have things i should mention
24:08   happening in WTC the social web working
24:11   group you should check out which is very
24:13   much in this space it's about very much
24:15   about decentralized power web authentic
24:18   occasion is a biggie all these systems
24:20   need authentication does web
24:22   authentication working group which has
24:23   taken over the Fido work there's also a
24:26   working group there's a community group
24:29   doing hardware token which you could
24:32   check out so those things are closed by
24:36   places where to find other like my
24:39   thinking people I think that also the
24:44   one of the things I will will see as a
24:46   merging of like is of the world of
24:49   synchronization of sync and
24:53   synchronization systems things which
24:55   think your phone on your laptop and and
24:57   bits of the cloud should start to be
25:00   indistinguishable from the where yeah
25:03   the web itself also you know a lot of
25:05   the websites out there actually behind
25:08   them there's a source code from system
25:09   like you I can see the website and you
25:11   can also follow a link to the github
25:13   repository where is where is the gift
25:16   source code control of all the different
25:18   versions of that website maybe we should
25:20   start introducing to http look the links
25:23   so that actually we start surfacing the
25:26   whole you know we basically surface get
25:28   or a redesign of get this the CDA to use
25:34   which we simply surface s becomes real
25:37   functionality so that we capture away
25:39   from versions and they're all visible in
25:42   a standard way wouldn't that be cool so
25:44   than that and when we do that then we
25:46   end up having common line you're just
25:50   for talking about the differences
25:51   between two versions and when you can
25:52   have common languages between talking
25:54   about the business the two versions
25:55   there are really cool things you can do
25:57   bypassing all the differences in a
25:59   document that you have on your laptop
26:01   between around the other people in the
26:03   boardroom as you are editing something
26:05   so that you don't have to even rely on
26:07   you can use the same technology but
26:08   actually the systems could talk to each
26:10   other over Bluetooth instead of because
26:13   they can lots of really exciting
26:16   possibilities and they can it together
26:18   in ways which which would mean to try to
26:21   elaborate all the connections will take
26:22   much too long I just wanted to throw in
26:25   some ways in which i'm a frustrated on
26:28   behalf of everybody uses you ever the
26:30   muppets
26:31   and stuck the Silas be very excited that
26:36   we can really read decentralize the web
26:40   and very excited that we've got
26:42   incredible group of people here and very
26:45   thankful to Brewster from company at the
26:49   archive for hosting or putting it all
26:51   together thank you very much
27:00   no way shall we take some questions if
27:03   you have a question for Sir Tim please
27:04   come this Mike find everyone to make it
27:10   a question not a statement and ask one
27:13   question and it don't have a clue how
27:15   many folk they go up at the end I guess
27:19   first happy birthday thank you and I
27:31   guess I am heartened by the fact that so
27:36   far lots of the talks have been about
27:38   values that we want and how we can sort
27:41   of define what we went ahead of time
27:42   before we go out try to build it but I
27:44   also wonder if you could comment just on
27:46   maybe the if you would just stay the top
27:48   three maybe promising projects that
27:52   achieve a lot of the things we've we've
27:54   already talked about like name date a
27:56   networking IP existence oh you know what
28:00   people ask me for my top three websites
28:02   and I always refuse because they are all
28:05   very wonderful so I asked the top figure
28:09   there are i would I sorry I'm not going
28:15   to take pic a top three because they are
28:17   wonderful in different ways it's not
28:19   that they're all trying to achieve one
28:21   particular thing and it's question who's
28:23   closest to the moon you know I got one
28:26   person as the moon shot we've got some
28:27   people working on fuel we've got some
28:29   people working on spacesuits we got some
28:31   people working on physics and navigation
28:35   and they also the interesting thing is
28:36   how they all fit together you can't put
28:39   them in order just like you can't put
28:40   people in order
28:47   hi Tim so I got involved a few years ago
28:51   and trying to keep a bunch of my friends
28:53   from joining a walled garden but they
28:55   were non-technical people and it was
28:58   ultimately impossible because the design
29:00   of that garden made it very easy for
29:02   them to understand what to do so how do
29:05   we get better design for our better for
29:09   the world versions of these things
29:10   because that's really the problem it's a
29:15   really important problem yes I agree one
29:19   of the week so when we're using a
29:22   decentralized system where if you try to
29:24   log on to a solid serve them the what
29:28   what you're doing when you first use
29:30   this you first use any of these
29:32   decentralized apps for the first time is
29:34   you're getting yourself an ID which will
29:37   allow you to use any decentralize app
29:39   and also to allow them to store data on
29:42   any server any other two servers you
29:43   choose even if you buy a freedom box and
29:46   plug it in at home because you know it's
29:47   also on source stuff on there and so
29:51   there are lots of possibilities and so
29:53   we how to make the sign up experience
29:57   just like you signed up for the simplest
29:59   social networking chat is one is a
30:02   really important goal and in a way of
30:05   all the user experience that they have
30:07   the sign up experience is kind of a
30:09   crucial one so that the onboarding so I
30:11   agree once further so I hope that one of
30:17   the things that we'll do is we'll end up
30:19   with really great designers pitching in
30:22   to look at the your exam just to rewind
30:25   you ought to just to rant but start my
30:29   pgp man pgp is a great system okay it's
30:32   a great the software UI is really
30:35   horrible it's being worked on by hardly
30:38   anybody with hardly any funds but for
30:41   example if you were to take the the GP
30:45   Jesus code and we're and take the
30:50   drop-down which says your key isn't
30:53   known you should launch the key manager
30:56   and go download it
30:57   and search for it and then store it and
31:00   then save it and then maybe this message
31:02   will go away and change it into a button
31:04   which just as all that okay Val you know
31:06   but there are some sometimes the things
31:08   are very obvious and the other places
31:11   systems where for years people haven't
31:13   put the effort into just smoothing out
31:15   and sometimes it's hope sometimes it's
31:18   not be as how and sometimes yeah but the
31:21   people of course like huge holds for
31:23   people who work in the in the walled
31:26   gardens do as gardeners they are paid
31:28   well but there it always turns out in a
31:34   long term that you can make the long
31:37   wall garden very very sweet but the
31:39   jungle outside is always more appealing
31:41   in the long term because because it's
31:43   got because it because of the diversity
31:44   which its producers so one of the cool
31:47   things is we in are decentralized world
31:49   we would have lots and lots of competing
31:50   apps and if we have good standards they
31:53   will store data in compatible forms so
31:55   you could switch from one run out what's
31:57   a while keeping preserving your entire
31:59   social graph and your contacts and your
32:01   factor in your life and your fitness and
32:03   all that you will be able to switch
32:05   choose which fitness apps in life than
32:08   in contact managing apps you can use
32:10   because you're because we're using
32:12   status and so that the weight will allow
32:14   us in a way will was will allow us to
32:21   now people move from one to another okay
```

_Q&A excerpted above_

```
35:18   hello thank you so much for attending
35:21   and for your work I'm wondering how you
35:24   feel about global access to the internet
35:28   and how keeping this sort of jungle open
35:30   allows you know like Africa is
35:32   considered a mobile-only market at this
35:34   point rather than mobile first and just
35:37   the way on you know traditionally
35:39   disadvantaged populations in the world
35:41   are starting to access the internet I'm
35:43   wondering if you think like keeping this
35:46   unsilent Internet allows people in those
35:49   areas to have the sort of access that we
35:51   all had in the 90s um and ultimately you
35:54   know everyone in this room were really
35:56   privileged to be embedded in tech to
35:58   this degree so just I'm wondering if
36:00   like the projects MIT and stuff like
36:02   that if they have any focus on you know
36:05   that's sort of access globally well
36:08   check out the web foundation for example
36:10   with additional org yeah we are right
36:12   now we are privileged we are the number
36:16   of people using the web when we started
36:20   the foundation we were shocked that it
36:22   was ten percent and twenty percent of
36:24   the world at that point for the first
36:26   time it would be cool we couldn't have
36:28   talked about it as human right when it
36:30   was pointed a reserved a one percent of
36:31   the people in the room but now it's
36:33   getting to these so we started web
36:35   foundation because wow what about all
36:37   those people who don't have access well
36:39   now let's come up to it's about
36:41   41-percent roughly so that means that
36:44   something very cool is there and a half
36:46   and something very historic is going to
36:47   happen it's going to the go from being
36:50   um soon next year or two it's going to
36:53   cost fifty percent and so suddenly what
36:54   was I minority thing will become a
36:56   majority thing so yes obviously a huge
36:59   amount of effort as we as we do that as
37:02   we go through this a lot of effort needs
37:04   to until they look at the lines for the
37:06   portable internet and things like that
37:08   a4ai org trying to just get the cost
37:12   down of devices get the cost down a
37:14   connectivity making sure there on time
37:15   reasonable taxes on monopolies across
37:18   the developing world so that's really
37:22   really important as we go through this
37:23   but then of course there's as it
37:25   suddenly becomes a majority there's a
37:27   different
37:28   in a way the issue purpose is something
37:31   different and now all the majority
37:33   people in the world have the half the
37:36   web so your business or government
37:37   doesn't have to really bother with the
37:38   people who done so the government's and
37:40   now the digital divide has become yo has
37:44   the gap has become bigger because
37:46   suddenly all the people made the
37:48   assumption that you are online and so
37:50   this so for the last twenty percent last
37:52   ten percent and we need to work a lot of
37:55   mitigation for how to help people live
37:57   who are not online and so on and so okay
38:02   what we'll do is I'll close the kutu
38:05   questions and just tediously questions I
38:12   said to close the queue to questions but
38:15   I take the ones which were on the queue
38:16   oh so I think the web platform my name
38:19   is Max the web platform has evolved an
38:21   amazing amount in the last ten years
38:24   javascript is a lot faster but I think
38:26   that a lot of the fundamental
38:28   innovations have kind of been accidental
38:30   or driven by big interests so for
38:33   example we got WebGL because people
38:35   wanted to make games on the browser and
38:36   then now we get as a side effect typed
38:39   arrays and we could work with binary
38:40   data which opens up a whole new section
38:42   of web apps and then we people wanted to
38:44   make video calls on the browser so we
38:46   got WebRTC and as a side effect we can
38:48   build these distributed file systems in
38:50   the browser do you think that we need as
38:52   a group one of these big interests to
38:54   push through the standards process that
38:55   secretly gives us these side effects
38:57   that we need like do you think as a
39:00   group we don't have the use case yet
39:02   that can get the standards implemented
39:05   because we need a kind of big semi-truck
39:06   to write in on do you think that's
39:08   accurate I don't think we need something
39:10   weird one I know I use this stuff for my
39:14   daily life I use it for my for example
39:17   if you invite me to something to a
39:21   seminar it goes into a track which is
39:23   all based on solid and so that's been
39:27   i've been using that basically say two
39:28   years and keeping it tracking the solids
39:31   dad and my feeling is that a lot that if
39:35   you want the sort of killer app it meet
39:37   one of the things so one possibility is
39:38   actually the early adopter community is
39:41   developers
39:42   because they can pick in his double
39:44   stuff and also they understand they they
39:46   will understand what's going on get all
39:48   excited about it and maybe just you know
39:51   we're using that we we have used IRC for
39:54   ages because it's been kind of had a
39:55   nice decentralized uncontrolled feel but
39:58   this there is a I think there's a slack
40:00   channel here no slack is another side of
40:03   you recommend my committee to tweet the
40:07   twitter is tricky because a big
40:09   centralized for a reason sack isn't
40:12   centralized for a reason it's
40:13   centralized just in the lots and lots of
40:15   versions this get your own stuff so one
40:16   possibilities yeah we just get together
40:18   afterwards tomorrow and we make a solid
40:21   based chat and basically whatever groups
40:26   need to organize and share meeting
40:29   materials and stuff like that when I've
40:31   known a few basic though so it could be
40:34   that it's not rocket science apps but
40:35   just day-to-day life really useful apps
40:37   could do it thanks hey my name is fun my
40:46   question is going to be about kind of
40:47   the frontier so we're here talking about
40:49   the centralization and location and
40:51   moving the web outside of some
40:53   particular point and adding content
40:55   addressing and all that kind of stuff
40:56   but there's a lot of other things going
40:58   on in the network right now so things
41:01   like Bitcoin reminded us that we can
41:02   have payment systems that are
41:03   decentralized we are getting overturned
41:05   in terms of the organizations or
41:08   authorities that run these systems where
41:12   one point O was about connecting all
41:13   these devices to be able to exchange
41:15   documents and be able to have
41:17   information sharing web two point O was
41:18   about making everything dynamic and
41:20   being able to have a read/write
41:21   connection with the websites what do you
41:25   think is web 3.0 there's things like the
41:27   blockchain that are giving us payment
41:29   systems and application processing
41:31   systems that are decentralized there's
41:33   things like the file systems that we're
41:34   going to talk about in this conference
41:37   that gives us that lifts the web form
41:38   location there's a lot of
41:40   disenfranchised people around the planet
41:42   people in developing world that can't
41:44   actually connect reliably to the rest of
41:46   the internet cannot have maintained a
41:47   proper connection what do you think r is
41:50   the frontier would love to hear more
41:53   about like various ideas
41:55   so for that piece low or there are
41:58   solutions coming along and low Earth
42:01   orbit satellites and things like that
42:02   that's a bit of a destruction let's go
42:03   back to the essential thing about the
42:05   sort of the where people yes the weather
42:11   said web of documents when you use and
42:14   when you download an app or web app when
42:16   it comes when you and you and you run it
42:20   you're running a bunch of JavaScript
42:21   very often you're actually exploring a
42:23   piece of data so in fact behind that is
42:26   the web of data so one of the directions
42:28   is exposing the weather data to users if
42:31   you like and I realized let them realize
42:32   that what they're looking when they're
42:34   looking at a bank statement presented by
42:35   their bank they could actually turn on a
42:38   bunch of really cool more powerful tools
42:39   to look at that bank statement and to do
42:42   their taxes and so on where they could
42:43   buy and pay good money for apps so
42:45   exposing the web of data is the in a way
42:50   true certain extent is what part answer
42:52   to the apt question the reason why
42:53   people have apps is because they need
42:55   powerful ways of looking at the data and
42:57   in fact yeah so maybe our will be a web
43:02   which is two pieces it's just the plain
43:04   doc you've anila documents that you will
43:06   just look at with a girl with a normal
43:08   browser and the and the space of data
43:12   which you explore using powerful tools
43:14   but tools which will be hopefully
43:18   archive able and um which will be
43:22   looking at standard you know that data
43:25   was you'll still be able to read in 20
43:26   years time okay I'd that ok so the pump
43:29   the I will take I wasn't going to take
43:31   us to question but this is something so
43:33   well with your answer um link data I've
43:37   watched the libraries and archives world
43:39   put a lot of effort into adopting
43:40   getting their heads around linked data
43:41   and then getting momentum up behind
43:43   adoption and now when I go into that
43:45   space and talk about decentralization I
43:48   some confusion comes up around
43:51   identifiers and I wonder in the rules of
43:55   linked data one of the rules is that
43:56   your identifier is our HTTP you are is
43:59   where HTTP was designed for the web of
44:02   documents right hypertext right so
44:06   do you feel like HTTP still has a role
44:10   in the web of data or no bugs no no no
44:14   web be a sheep he was not designed for
44:18   web of documents in the sense of worth
44:20   upwards of documents he was designed to
44:23   be a set of identifiers anything and
44:25   then what know this man webb says is you
44:27   can use you can you make a URI to talk
44:30   about this church this organization
44:33   yourself so the so if you wait and in
44:36   fact so quick web where architecture 101
44:41   the hash the web architecture is the
44:44   hash the web the web design is we will
44:47   take the advise of documents and we will
44:50   put a hash and then after the hash we
44:52   will put something else which depending
44:54   on what system you're in identify
44:56   something within the document so this
44:58   can be a document about the church and
45:00   then hash this church itself is the
45:02   church itself ok so RDF uses heb
45:07   differently to the way HTML uses it and
45:10   it doesn't in fact so you can use these
45:13   I and you can use these identifiers just
45:18   as identifies you can use from like
45:19   ashes if you like all the times you look
45:21   you can cash them and you can hash them
45:22   and you can you can you earn and in fact
45:24   because they start with hcv you could
45:26   look them up as well but that's and
45:29   that's something that you always need we
45:32   can change yeah we sometimes you need
45:35   different sometimes you use you need to
45:37   have your end through most of the time
45:38   almost always you need to have something
45:40   you know it's fairly able to look these
45:42   things up so I think you know what I'd
45:46   like to be able to do is to stick with
45:47   using HTTP and you for the namespace and
45:52   then morph and then a week and we're
45:54   constantly changing nippy's constantly
45:56   changing htp to is a complete redesign
45:58   just came out okay we're constantly
46:01   adding headers to it in the solid
46:03   project and other projects because you
46:05   can throw in your other headers so
46:06   things so if you want to use it in a
46:09   particular way for a semantic web
46:12   identifies are things which are
46:13   distributed between different desktops
46:15   or for example or in a very peer-to-peer
46:18   way
46:19   you can you can do that so anyway we can
46:23   talk about let's talk about this at the
46:24   break thank you
46:31   let's give it up for Sir Tim berners-lee
46:33   on his birthday
46:41   for the history books
