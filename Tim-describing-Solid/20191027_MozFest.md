"Hard to follow (?) up after just just explaining what a dystopian place we live in. I can’t fix them all, but a lot of people at the moment, of the list of thing, of serious issues with this, a lot of people end up worrying about the bottom on on the list which is privacy and in a way that has been a hook for the Solid project. Hands up how many people in this room have come across the Solid project and know what it is? So we have this project called solid.mit.edu and the partly the reason that you haven’t heard of it is that it’s only just broken the surface of the water. The new website just came live a couple of weeks ago so you’re forgiven for not coming across it. Solid is, in a way, to improve the web a bit. All the same web protocols but in a way to revolutionise the way it works. So totally, the privacy thing is."

# 20191027_MozFest_02:05
"Solid thinks that you should have complete control of all your data. You should control all your data.  And so, that is difficult to get, to achieve. You think, what? Facebook controls it? But never mind about Facebook, ok. Let’s imagine, never mind how many billions of people are on Facebook. That's irrelevant. We’re going to build a small community in which we  believe that people should completely own their data." 

# 20191027_MozFest_02:35
"So to be able to control your data that means you need to be able to choose where to store it. So that means you need several places, well at least one place, to store it. If you go to solid.community or inrupt.net then you’ll be able to go and get yourself an account there and that will give you a place to store your data which, that will be in a cloud, that, at the moment, is run by inrupt. Down the road, clouds will be run by all sorts of people. You will have personal clouds. Hopefully you will be able to find people that you really trust." 

# 20191027_MozFest_03:03
And sometimes you may decide that rather than just using free stuff I'd rather pay some money for a piece of personal cloud a piece of personal storage. 

# 20191027_MozFest_03:11
These things we call them Pods by the way. 

# 20191027_MozFest_03:14
Now I have, a lot of, you may be if you are a geek, and quite a lot of you are geeks in this room. You may go straight back buy a 19 inch rack, fill it with servers and that is your Solid Pod and start offering Solid Pods to you and your friends. So I have a Solid Pod at home in the US. So under American law rather than subpoenaing, you know, Dropbox to get my data, then the American police would have to get a search warrant to go through my house. So some people really take, there are a group of people who are really, who are at one end of the spectrum, whatever they are. 

These are even better. These are Solid stickers. And if can’t get them here you can find them at our table, where we are for the rest of the day. Upstairs. 

# 20191027_MozFest_04:16
So Solid, started off being driven by privacy. That feeling that I want to just be able to arrange to meet with somebody, discuss a topic, I want to have a chat, without it contributing to all that stuff. I don’t want it to contribute to the monetization of the data stream, I don’t want it contributing to people understanding and knowing more about me, targeting me more effectively with advertising. I don’t want to be manipulated. I just want it to sit there under my control. 

# 20191027_MozFest_04:48
The Solid architecture is that the apps and the data are completely separate. That is a big change. If you are a developer, this is in a way, really cool. If you’re a developer then normally you build a front end which is the bit in the JavaScript in the browser that talks to the user and you build the backend which runs on the server it has bits of PHP and node and stuff and databases. And every time you add features to the front end you’ve got to, a new feature or a new concept, you’ve got to, change the backend and the frontend. But, Solid is sort of revolutionary in the sense that we have a common backend, there is no more backend programming. You can develop Solid apps, you don’t do any backend work. All your Solid apps will run on any platform, they just. When the app runs, you just ask the user ‘ where do you want this stored?’ and the user points you to their storage. And when they, you get the read write stuff from the storage. 

but also because this is all linked beta so in fact when you start using youor not just you're not in fact living ina world where I'm just just having this chat and I'm just sharing my only with myself they're really cool the powerful thing about Solid is you can share anything we don't have anything

# 20191027_MozFest_06:05
so you can choose where you store data 

# 20191027_MozFest_06:07
you can choose who you share stuff with 

# 20191027_MozFest_06:12
and the idea is that because this is you know it's a general platform where everybody and have ID you can have more than one ID 
# 20191027_MozFest_06:14
but different personas that you can have but you can anybody who gives you a business card with a college ID on ityou can take that business back home and you can go to that address and then you can drag there do well into your access control panel though you're for the photograph of the whatever it is you want to share with them and you can get them access so you can give the moment for example your in reality if you want you can go to the hospital website and you can there your medical stuff with your doctor and you dare set up to do to share things so on this they are medical tests and resultsof diagnosis and things okay meanwhile and a completely different site you can search things that you can share your photos with your family and friends who are on some social network but you can't share if you take a picture of your knee you can't share it with your doctor and in fact you want to share your medical stuff with your cousin and the but all this stuff is in silos the solid is about breaking down the silo solid tops of each one into if you want to build you can take your your silo of your existing tire it may be a wonderful app and you can go away after you've heard this talk and chop it into and take all the user interface stuff which is wonderful mix and allows people to do wonderful things elaborate and just make it run on top of a server and when it started making money make it right on top of a solid Pod when the solid one is a generic API 

# 20191027_MozFest_07:55
Okay so Solid,it's a standard mostly you know it's just HTTP and it's based HTTP and
it's also access control standards so it's not just a HTTP we have to add things


to it it's also we've got things like
08:03
standards for doing contact so that
08:05
every path can access your contact
information and things like that so it's
08:11
a it's a standard we've got company what
08:16
society from my point of view is the
08:17
first time in a gazillion years like
08:19
since the 80s oh no working with a
08:21
start-up and yeah it's called enrapt
08:25
intercom an interrupt has also there
08:28
what's been nice is been able to watch
08:32
this for several years we had nice
08:34
research funding for who is MIT now it's
08:38
appropriate now to just be a put more
08:40
energy into it who you never got we have
08:42
commercial funding from Gosling ventures
08:45
my others and to make this thing having
08:49
so we can put we can
08:51
but people on getting my making
08:53
documentation we still have we have a
08:55
finite number of people so in fact what
08:57
interruptus done also is benefited
08:59
enough just in the few days that it's
09:01
been running we've had this tremendous
09:03
surge of people arriving online people
09:06
arriving here as well when we're in the
09:09
science we have as people in science
09:10
fair I'm sorry if I heard from somebody
09:12
today who couldn't get to it because it
09:14
was because he couldn't
09:16
because there are too many people but
09:18
but you can go there we'll have whatever
09:21
stairs you can get stickers there but uh
09:25
there's still sort of what's amazing
09:28
about it has been the the amount of
09:33
enthusiasm out there I suppose people
09:35
some people say your documentation is
09:37
non-existent
09:38
I've blogged this is this is I tried it
09:42
I put all the buttons I figured out how
09:44
it worked and this is my blog and we had
09:46
a couple of people doing that which is
09:47
totally wonderful other people and so
09:50
now we have got we got a guest channel
09:52
but discussing the documentation
09:54
problems and actually and creating
09:56
groups of people to pay documentation
09:58
we've got people working on defleshed
10:00
this is the software of the server the
10:02
server is something which basically is
10:05
pretty that's most developed but so you
10:07
can get the ref you can so you can
10:08
install it it's a new NPM install loader
10:12
solid server and it should run go onto
10:15
Agata channel if you if you need help
10:18
getting your running the apps are really
10:21
early days because the idea is to get a
10:23
server you know the community needs to
10:26
create the server once it's booting
10:28
server that everybody can make that
10:29
we've got some apps I've got some apps
10:31
I've got I run all of my life on apps
10:33
most of my life actually runs easy solid
10:35
apps but but the idea is that there will
10:39
be thousands of flowers blooming
10:41
millions of hours blooming when the apps
10:43
but their work that goes into the
10:46
backend into the solid servers will have
10:49
them written in different languages if
10:51
you're interested go programmers see me
10:52
afterwards and so for example but the
10:58
the way the architecture works is work
11:00
on the server is finite we technically
11:03
we have to maintain air what how to make
11:04
new versions and stuff and all the
11:07
energy goes into the app because the
11:08
apps run in the browser or they run on
11:10
the car or now this is computer they run
11:13
under and the spirit of probably deficit
11:16
is
11:18
on behalf of the user when you're
11:20
writing your solid app you are not
11:22
trying to trick them we're going to have
11:25
a concept of a beneficent app and maybe
11:28
a brand
11:29
so maybe benefit in depth so all all
11:31
twist about it where if you put the
11:33
benefits never land on it it means you
11:35
have sworn as a developer to act that
11:38
your software will act on behalf of user
11:41
you will not buy to trick them into
11:43
buying something in the middle of what
11:45
they're doing you will try to help them
11:47
contribute what they're doing
11:49
you will help them collaborate your help
11:51
them communicate well and so though that
11:54
is that is a spirit it's a new spirit
11:56
people say where are you going to get
11:57
who's going to fund it if this is going
11:59
to be advertising well guess what I
12:01
think that we've got a also a lot of
12:04
people who are after the fake news wave
12:07
are saying you know what I realized I
12:10
have to pay I want virginal II need to
12:13
pay for news cuz I want to pay for
12:15
somebody figure out my the things that I

12:19
tell me things that I can trust I
12:20
realized actually I can do and prepares
12:24
to pay like you give me free data yet
12:26
but I I might pay just pay for this data
12:28
storage because I respect that this data
12:31
storage that I am using the solid pod
12:33
doesn't abuse me and I'll pay for that
12:35
to keep the whole system going and I
12:38
will pay I'll donate 200 use open source
12:40
apps but I will donate to them to keep
12:43
the developers food on the table because
12:45
I really respect these apps cuz these
12:48
apps that they called user agents you
12:50
know Mozilla the the noble Firefox is a
12:53
is a user agent technically it's called
12:55
user agent that was the term for the
12:59
time and the idea of that was it
13:01
represents the user that's kind of II
13:03
not that's coming back with a solid apps
13:05
are use agents they work on behalf of
13:07
users it's a new revolution it's
13:09
different but
13:12
very exciting you and you join in thank
13:15
you for yours
13:25
and we have a question
13:34
you
13:36
just the practicalities how are we going
13:38
to convince the current sets of siloed
13:42
data they were opener hospitals or
13:45
whatever
13:47
that seems like a long boat well
13:50
spacious say that and in fact that's
13:52
been one of us have concerns is how will
13:54
we get into most people have got all
13:55
their data in a silo but mine mind you
13:58
just recently a few weeks ago did you
14:00
conquer
14:01
data transfer project so the data
14:03
transfer project is Google and Facebook
14:07
and Microsoft and Twitter and and the
14:11
and their partners discern announced
14:14
within the data transfer project by the
14:17
way we will all give you the right the
14:19
ability the technical ability to
14:21
download your data from one silo and
14:24
move it into another silo so that means
14:27
you can download it and so you can go
14:29
and Google already done this you can go
14:31
to Google takeout and in fact Apple
14:34
wasn't in that list but there's a few
14:36
days later Apple now announced they have
14:38
a so now I've just tried it myself so
14:40
you get you say I want for my data and
14:43
they say well when you say all data this
14:44
there are 30 different classifications
14:46
of data what do you want and then we
14:48
will prepare it for you and then you can
14:51
download it and then you come back to
14:53
the site awhile later and they prefer
14:54
prepare a few an archive file and you
14:58
can put it on a computer and you can
14:59
unwrap it and so what we're working on
15:01
now is all the difference and this is
15:03
yes help would be lovely from the open
15:06
source community is writing the code to
15:08
take it from Google format and Apple
15:13
format and so on and converts it into a
15:16
solid format so that you can run your
15:17
apps directly so instead of moving it
15:19
back into another silo to do your photos
15:22
actually you use your favorite open
15:25
source photo editor and photo slideshow
15:30
manager and stuff on your honor
15:34
you pick your solid apps great thing
15:36
about solid you know is you can use lots
15:37
of different apps and you can at the
15:39
same time on the same day I say and you
15:41
can also if there's any app if you're a
15:43
developer or you can for your any of it
15:45
you don't appreciate you can
15:48
make it better Devore so that's so the
15:52
Google Data transfer project is one
15:55
example
15:56
why did you know you asked in my deserts
15:59
and they all say out of the goodness of
16:00
their heart and because they believe
16:01
that they feel that they're if you were
16:06
as a user they feel that they should set
16:09
the bar high so that if you say with us
16:12
you haven't eaten because you haven't
16:13
been pleased it's because we've brought
16:15
you with the best experience my mind you
16:19
there is teaching whether the service
16:25
that may work
16:28
happy Oh and so
16:33
although think so that's an so yeah
16:35
banking there's a radio from banking in
16:37
the UK so bit by bit I think given open
16:40
banking given TTP if you're something
16:42
else like if you're a fitness machine
16:44
you know you know if we go if you go to
16:47
fitness machine company and say I want
16:48
my data then okay well then there are
16:51
plenty of you can go to a different gym
16:53
if this one won't give you your data but
16:55
I think they will change this has been
16:57
reached a tipping point and that this
17:00
tipping point is just realizing that
17:03
your data belongs to you and it's your
17:05
right
17:08
we've heard about the
17:10
today's whim you've got the mic where
17:12
I'm here in the middle okay
17:15
github perpetuates this tragedy attracts
17:18
uses an unusal alight it replaces its
17:21
inherently distributed workflow with a
17:24
centralized one it requires proprietary
17:27
software
17:27
it has vendor lock-in it blots innocent
17:30
users based on their location alone many
17:33
ethical alternatives exist so why do you
17:37
host solid on github good question first
17:41
of all because know what what should we
17:44
vote so what will be better than getup
17:46
well obviously a slight modification
17:48
which I've been suggesting to all my
17:50
friends who code you know every few
17:52
every few weeks is that these can we
17:54
have something which will take all of
17:56
the site use the github API extract all
18:00
of the status of all the push pull
18:02
requests all of the stuff which is
18:03
github but not it and put it into get so
18:07
that you have a repo which has got and
18:10
you know and you have a metal repo which
18:12
has got all the discussion so in fact
18:13
the whole thing is distributed so that
18:15
you can then run it on and then you can
18:17
so the idea is so we'll then what I like
18:19
to do is clearly is yes you could
18:24
you could use an open-source alternative
18:26
silo or help us code a solid app so that
18:31
anybody on any solid pod and just say
18:33
I'm going to be opening a github like
18:37
repository we have I mean what does it
18:40
need
18:41
it needs being of explore files it needs
18:44
some basic UI which isn't rocket science
18:46
it's got chat we got chat code so we've
18:50
got you know quite a lot of pieces of us
18:52
so yeah I think a distributed to to be
18:56
able to say this is my repo on my solid
19:00
pod and every veto and allowing people
19:03
to clone it but and they clean it they
19:05
end up cloning not own only the code but
19:08
also the author all other discussion as
19:10
well so yeah that will be far above
19:13
better
19:17
oh no moon we're on guitar if you talk
19:19
to us we'd love to give you which is
19:22
your wish would you recommend like it's
19:25
level Oh
19:33
you
19:37
what we used but yeah this is
19:40
distributed the problem is the social
19:41
piece of it
19:42
boom crashing off so that's what we want
19:44
to move
19:45
so yeah the but I think the good step
19:48
for the community to do is to have a
19:50
standard or all of
19:53
or the order also he said
19:56
get up I agree any stereo ironic that
20:00
this wonderful wonderful decent rise the
20:03
web community all our centralized on
20:05
guitar yes
20:08
thank you thank you very much for the
20:09
over here thank you
20:11
the presentation you've spoken about the
20:13
privacy and went around solid and the
20:17
idea of trust could you speak a little
20:19
bit about the potential for the solid
20:21
platform in terms of truly anonymous
20:23
interaction
20:25
sure so when you interact online
20:29
I think the solid platform the I a lot
20:36
of the apps that we build burbling bit
20:38
off for collaboration and they often
20:39
between collaboration between people and
20:41
people in this room who collaborate
20:42
whether whether with a professional
20:46
identity and so if you're in this room
20:49
when you put up your size you want
20:50
people know your your LinkedIn profile
20:53
if using then your Twitter profile on
20:55
you they want you you want you should
20:57
know where you've published your papers
20:59
and so so the sent to a certain extent
21:02
as a there's a role for for
21:07
they talk about people which is very
21:08
very open in public but then when it but
21:11
then if your whistle or if your they get
21:14
to go into a mode where you want to do
21:17
something quietly or you want to have a
21:19
very different the world start with you
21:21
can have as many you you can have as
21:25
many solid IDs as you want
21:28
and you don't have to have any
21:30
connection between them
21:32
other things you do which is by need is
21:34
for example you can if I have to know
21:37
you through a completely different who
21:40
are sailing together or something it may
21:42
be that I will know that that you're
21:45
Monica and the sailing club is the same
21:46
as your Monica that you've used when you
21:48
go to malls fest and so I might be able
21:50
to when I look at your stuff I might see
21:52
all of your blogs in both sides because
21:54
you've told me but I saw that a little
21:56
piece of information very privately in
21:58
my contacts although interesting things
22:00
you can do there but but and but also
22:04
you can have you can also meant a a
22:07
solid ID not attach anything to us at
22:11
all go and make your point you know go
22:13
through tour to a solid provider mints
22:15
something have your discussion make your
22:18
point and then disappear and
22:22
here so the question is
22:28
the question is what would you build
22:30
with the trillion dollars
22:33
you can't say solid
22:38
if I had to trillion dollars
22:41
doc bill
22:43
uh well I start by making the
22:45
distributed get
22:47
uh-huh but but what I would build and
22:51
fill of those stuff with but it would
22:53
all be based on solid it would all be
22:54
solid it'd all be solid at so
22:59
I'm
23:00
gonna build anything now which is motive
23:02
compatible uh I don't I'm not gonna
23:05
build a silo
23:07
I'm just gonna build everything
23:08
everything that was
23:12
but Java check
23:17
quick question technically it sounds
23:21
very elegant I just wondered if there's
23:24
any environmental concerns with kind of
23:27
moving to such a decentralized model as
23:31
mean I guess say what you like about
23:33
Facebook Google you know they obviously
23:35
have learned how to build very efficient
23:38
large-scale datacenters I just wanted
23:41
any concerns around decentralizing in
23:45
that way advice you might have it's a
23:48
good question so I'm not an expert on
23:49
the on the ecological efficiency of my
23:55
brother is closer to that asking Mike
23:58
but so it is a good question I think
24:02
never I think I'd never be sure whether
24:05
all are worried about the huge data
24:08
centers is whether in fact it's as
24:12
serious as worrying about everybody
24:14
having each other they've run it they
24:16
leave running and so on and if you do if
24:18
you do have a server at home then it
24:20
does have an assay on but so building
24:24
servers which can be very which vary
24:28
which wind down mentally don't have
24:30
hands and for example have and the art
24:35
of building center like that that is
24:37
quite important I think that in fact
24:39
solid I imagine a lot of the solid part
24:41
will be on a on machines that are all
24:44
earlier ha between a thousand and one
24:48
hundred thousand and many and many of
24:52
them will have them anymore so the many
24:54
were there will be big riders but on the
24:56
other hand it is nice that you can you
24:59
can get a Raspberry Pi and you and put a
25:02
disk on it and you can download the
25:04
solid server on it and you can be and
25:06
people done that ok they've got solid
25:08
solid balls running on rusty pipes now
25:11
occupies it might turn out to be
25:13
horribly inefficient if they are the way
25:14
or every saw their data but it's very
25:17
cool to be able to put or OData just an
25:20
erosion flag gotta say so yeah and the
25:23
total effect on environment yeah we
25:26
should think about it down the line some
25:28
interesting page but the spirit of being
25:32
free with your own Rogers pie I think
25:34
for such a man I would have to cook with
25:38
the warming is it over the path that
25:40
introduces requested her
25:45
in Iran
25:47
Oh is there going to be some sort of
25:50
moderation on what data is actually
25:52
stored on odds on the solid pods because
25:55
what you long ago this great new system
25:58
for sharing files came around little bit
25:59
boring but these days people use
26:01
Victorian to download pirated media so
26:04
how are you gonna maybe protect solid
26:07
not becoming that really good question
26:10
because yeah but other people would say
26:12
how can you will you promise not to stop
26:15
solid becoming that so people say if I
26:18
use solid but I should be able use it
26:19
for my pirated media via so some people
26:22
wonder the stream will say but that's
26:23
free speech be able to send over my
26:25
power parity media so what is tricky at
26:29
the moment
26:30
though I think two related questions
26:32
that I'm less worried about well in fact
26:36
I'm boom worried in a way yes I'm
26:38
worried about people use abusing solid
26:40
in lots of different ways that's one the
26:43
if the article 13 gets through European
26:50
we've got through your palm comes law
26:52
then now that there's a law coming along
26:56
which would mean that I would have to
26:58
not only take down stuff that dizzy
27:01
tells me is is infringing but also
27:03
construct my service so that nobody
27:06
could ever upload them again that would
27:08
be you know that we can't do that with
27:10
all sort of software we can't do that
27:11
with our team which I haven't gotten in
27:14
anyway we talk about privacy so we're
27:16
not going to have adults ravaging
27:20
through all our users files to find out
27:22
whether they're pornographic or whether
27:24
they're or whether they're parish and so
27:25
on so that that is not a simple question
27:27
to answer
27:28
I think but following on the previous
27:31
poking away at the question I'm in a way
27:33
more interested in which is more
27:35
important Hannett American because the
27:38
corporate copyright system is kind of
27:39
broken anyway but
27:42
hate speech and radicalization online
27:46
yeah anybody if you want to start if you
27:49
wanna recognize people invite them to
27:50
your solid community it's a great way of
27:53
thousand you effort community in which
27:55
you create a world of of completely fake
27:59
values and so on so yeah I think when
28:04
you look up what's up
28:07
was used by whatsapp groups were used to
28:09
radical to to get people to believe that
28:13
they should saw so there hang here for
28:15
example in Myanmar and they did sorts of
28:19
people in Myanmar and the Facebook one
28:22
what happened they didn't really do
28:24
anything about it is they calm well that
28:25
is he lifted and that's where people
28:27
like it and so as massive look so lots
28:31
of tricky questions about if you want it
28:33
if you want to build a system
28:36
shouldn't we should yeah on one right
28:38
and we should give other people's
28:40
privacy is taraj extent is it is assured
28:43
with them how do you there's always been
28:47
this comforter this conflict between the
28:50
needs of law enforce
28:52
and the leaves of the privacy of
28:54
reasonable human being sent
28:57
that's always a debate in this country
28:59
is swung recently looked quite a lot
29:02
over towards the demands of lon
29:07
okay Oh
29:12
but my question is how can we help we
29:15
partner and how can we help promote
29:16
solids because I'm based here in the
29:20
Olympic and I know it's a big data
29:22
project they're about how they can use
29:24
people's data to help them navigate the
29:26
part with a view to actually expending
29:28
that if it works for the part it's gonna
29:29
work for London beyond and my question
29:31
is have we helped so well involve solid
29:34
in your project build build build the
29:36
apps so that they store users data if
29:38
you have to use user data
29:40
ask them to log in with a solid and then
29:42
you'll have access to their odd as a
29:45
read/write space and you can store all
29:48
the history of them wandering around
29:49
Rock and what they like and there and
29:53
then you can allow them to share it with
29:55
people if they wanted to or otherwise
29:56
not share depending on what they were
29:58
doing in the park I suppose and so
30:00
there's but yeah that's a great example
30:04
of a Civic app right where you're
30:07
building it for the community one thing
30:08
is you could have a solid pod where you
30:11
put all the park data and you have to
30:13
and you have a one run by the town run
30:17
by the by the project which
30:20
we're gonna have discussions about what
30:22
what we should do with the park or about
30:24
what what would be better instead of
30:26
that ugly thing in in the park those
30:29
we're going to host and we're going to
30:30
store them you can keep copies of them
30:33
but we're gonna store them all right on
30:35
our pod because it's house you know it's
30:38
a civic thing this is an open public
30:39
public vision and the chat will be
30:42
archived and it will be real forever and
30:44
people get understand why we came to
30:46
these discussions so when you're doing
30:50
civic things having a pod which is which
30:53
is uses the same architect but it says
30:56
let's be open about this and lock it
30:58
open it is great that people meanwhile
31:02
come along and put the bookmark be part
31:05
of they could put their bookmarks over
31:08
this last part like in their own solid
31:11
private basis of the nobody that nobody
31:13
needs to know which bits they like
31:16
yeah Oh
31:19
I think that's a an excellent way to
31:23
celerity of the Olympic everyone we're
31:26
going to break for lunch for an hour and
31:27
a half certain thank you very much come
31:29
back home 15 please there's more
