[Original recording of talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9Anv5Yv_k) 

Wow oh it's great to be here thanks for
01:59
having me
02:01
great to hear previous talks and learned
02:04
something about all the this new
02:07
technology myself so application
02:10
networks and the web your age you asked
02:13
me to talk about and it's been testing
02:15
because I've been thinking about how
02:20
there are different but also about how
02:23
they're similar in fact so I've been
02:25
working with I thought actually I did it
02:27
before my project its own I had to say
02:31
before the World Wide Web I worked on
02:33
RPC projects remote procedure call you
02:36
know it's that it's an early precursor
02:38
of api's and then so so I sort of been
02:43
that and then that in a very crude
02:44
fashion at CERN with calling putting
02:47
together programs by calling different
02:50
things although at that point we were
02:51
calling functions which worked right
02:53
down in the bottom of the pit
02:55
accelerator so certain extent over the
02:59
last 30 years api's data and documents
03:02
have evolved in some ways very similar
03:05
in some ways they're very different
03:06
api's the goal is to put together
03:09
eventually a huge successful computation
03:12
you've got a big function you got the IT
03:15
of your business if you're putting
03:17
together where data and documents it's
03:19
the idea is to put together well Dana
03:21
actually it's to do with knowledge
03:23
that's why we when we talk about the
03:24
Semantic Web we mean it's not just about
03:26
the computer having keeping track of
03:29
bits of documen document and the words
03:35
that contain it's about human
03:36
understanding it's about the computer
03:38
understanding what that's about
03:39
so machine readable acquisition of
03:43
building knowledge in both cases I
03:46
suppose we need the connectivity
03:49
everything we build runs over the
03:50
Internet we need to have it open we need
03:54
to have it neutral we need to have it
03:55
secure whatever the systems are in both
04:01
cases I suppose when you're looking at
04:02
the world of building big data systems
04:04
and big we have disco
04:06
somebody else must have done this really
04:09
where is it with code we're going to I
04:13
spent a lot of time going to my favorite
04:16
current packet manager NPM getting in
04:19
asking NPM to install things pulling in
04:21
huge amounts of stuff that other people
04:22
have written other people have tested
04:24
and building things very quickly by
04:28
pulling in modules when you do the same
04:30
with data then you going out walking for
04:32
you're going to something like lov
04:34
you're looking at people who've lists
04:37
databases of databases you're going to
04:39
the linked open data cloud the lod cloud
04:42
looking at a list of all somebody
04:44
massive what's or area in my am who's
04:46
who will have pulled in all the states
04:48
are together pulling together public
04:51
data putting together public code
04:55
completely different communities you
04:57
know some ways the same in both cases
05:01
self describing api's Ravel to being one
05:06
in a series of api description for a
05:10
program and in device description
05:14
languages which go back through the ages
05:16
and then for if your data is in the RDF
05:21
model you heard the audio schema
05:22
language you have the ontology language
05:24
all you have shape languages like
05:26
shackle and checks which allow you to
05:30
describe the shapes so these are things
05:32
which is allow you to just make things
05:34
self describing so you in both sizes you
05:36
have the self describing a world and in
05:39
both cases you've got the this open
05:42
community
05:43
you've got the open-source community on
05:46
the side of api's that will you to just
05:50
populate the API and all the other API
05:53
so it depends on down the chain and then
05:56
you've got the open data community which
05:59
will allow you in a different sort of
06:00
way not so tree like maybe more grant
06:02
graph like but the open data community
06:04
is hoping whole community are really
06:07
part by the way even if you feel your
06:09
enterprise is enterprises the piece for
06:14
you that's where you add your value that
06:15
you're providing helping an enterprise
06:17
manager their data actually if
06:19
when somebody in your organization about
06:23
what the site they will be looking at
06:26
corporate data yes but actually also
06:29
that it's very important that their
06:30
calendar will pull in their personal
06:32
data as well and it's also really
06:34
important that they pull in the public
06:36
data they pull in that feed from their
06:38
favorite band they put in the u2 concert
06:39
so they can think okay interesting mean
06:42
stuff going on mule stuff how can I fit
06:44
that in the meeting with the u2 concert
06:45
the mule soft may be proprietary data
06:48
the u2 concert is public information
06:51
both really really important for one
06:53
person's life for one instantaneous
06:55
decision of what to do that night has
06:57
you've got a bearish or they don't over
06:59
that so integration of data in data its
07:02
integration across the whole range of
07:04
what we call the data spectrum from the
07:06
very personal very private to the very
07:08
public treated in some ways very
07:11
differently but in some ways for very
07:15
sometimes you merge it all together you
07:18
know an individual person's gotta be
07:19
able to see them all together not just
07:21
for calendar data if that should happen
07:23
for all the data all types of data in
07:25
life I think both things could be read
07:29
only or read right there's a lot of
07:32
valid times when you give put somebody
07:34
yeah you give all your customers a
07:36
read-only access to your catalogue
07:37
whether it's an API for wandering
07:40
through your products or it's open data
07:42
there's times when you just give them
07:44
read-only data but it's time when well
07:46
then there's times when you rise that
07:48
the supply chain if you could actually
07:49
share information or allow people not
07:52
only to annotate the products with the
07:53
things you know give them the you allow
07:56
your customers to put their star ratings
07:59
on your products then you're so opening
08:01
up the making more of a two-way
08:04
communication things like the supply
08:06
chain tend to work better as a two-way
08:10
communication when you've got feedback
08:12
going both ways so often it's
08:14
interesting to look at something when
08:16
there's a read-only API for example when
08:18
I on the data side when I the town dumps
08:23
out there the list of all the fix the
08:26
the things they need to fix in the roads
08:28
they have the pothole database rapidly
08:32
they discovered that
08:34
the other side opens of open data air is
08:38
actually making that a readwrite
08:39
database is saying okay this is our
08:41
current set of databases mind you if you
08:43
see anything that if you if you know a
08:46
pothole so we don't you don't know of
08:49
then please put it in and in fact that
08:51
attitude of changing making the list of
08:54
things that have to be done in the
08:55
community readwrite thing that can be
08:57
not just an efficient way of obtaining
09:00
maintaining the talents to do lists
09:02
effectively but I can it can be a change
09:05
of emphasis a change of attitude to you
09:10
know running this town if something's
09:11
got to be done and it's going to be done
09:13
in a collaboration between the citizens
09:15
and the town and so actually having a
09:18
readwrite space of data where we can
09:20
together share that list of possible
09:23
problems and tag onto it the list of
09:26
possible solutions oh don't worry that's
09:29
outside my door don't you know I will
09:31
chop that tree don't you guys guys do it
09:34
I'll handle that I got that one solo if
09:36
I sort of it turns the whole it can make
09:39
the whole not only make then the
09:41
computer system more efficient it can
09:42
make the town more efficient because
09:44
you're using people can a burly battery
09:47
but could and you're doing it by giving
09:49
them a collaborative shared space of
09:52
read/write data so readwrite the
09:55
read/write read-only things are good to
09:59
good to visit and we revisit I suppose
10:05
it's you could say well it's crazy you
10:08
comparing these things they are so chalk
10:10
and cheese so in some ways yes they are
10:12
very different why we're talking one
10:14
case you're you took your api's you're
10:17
talking about functions you're talking
10:18
about procedures you're talking about
10:20
code you're talking about stuff which is
10:23
it's procedural that fundamentally this
10:28
whereas the data that's procedural this
10:31
is declarative those are those offices
10:34
ends in you know in computer science
10:36
everybody spends their time so having
10:40
having attacks of loving procedural
10:43
having attacks of loving declarative
10:44
people spend the time trying to convert
10:47
things that they've done and very
10:48
procedural way and make them more
10:49
declarative or sometimes look at driving
10:54
the other way then they realize that
10:56
they have a wonderful procedural system
10:58
which we actually is best done by
10:59
prioritizing years and the parameters
11:02
are just data and so that they can build
11:04
declarative system which which run off
11:06
that and so on so in a way procedural
11:09
declarative has been one of the just two
11:14
facets to ways of looking at the world
11:17
two sets of tools that you need two sets
11:20
of sort of definitely coloured
11:21
spectacles with which you can look at
11:23
anything any problem it's interesting
11:25
that in think about procedures functions
11:29
then good function design is all about
11:32
data hiding in a way the most important
11:34
thing when you know in your favorite
11:36
programming language you make a function
11:37
it you wrap up the function and all the
11:40
internal variables you hide some
11:43
languages you hide them automatically
11:44
sometimes you hide the button by
11:45
convention but the whole point is that
11:47
when I call your function I don't have
11:49
to worry and you don't allow me to mess
11:52
with the ways that the intermediate
11:54
values because you reserve the right to
11:56
change the way it works afterwards so
11:58
you're gonna just do something you got
12:00
to provide a certain functionality
12:01
you're just gonna convert this thing
12:05
from one format to another and all the
12:07
intermediate values or you're gonna make
12:10
a decision about whether this is a good
12:12
one whether this is one is it when we're
12:13
going to take on one we're going to
12:14
throw out and all of the intermediate
12:17
values which you arrived at you keeps
12:19
yourself so you can change those
12:21
algorithms afterwards so information
12:22
hiding is all it is big part of the
12:26
concept of procedure functional
12:29
programming and api's and whereas
12:32
information sharing is then what
12:34
everybody talks about with data with
12:36
data one of the issues for a lot of us
12:39
in the world is that we've got data we
12:43
have on a good day we have data like the
12:46
calendar we have personal data that I
12:49
control I have my own personal calendar
12:51
I have current things I share with
12:54
people very close to me
12:56
I have team and group calendars and all
12:58
these various organizations you've heard
12:59
of most associated with
13:01
I have calendars which I share with them
13:03
and I have these public mmm cubby can't
13:06
can't isn't I have and it turn it turns
13:10
out the calendars I can share friendly
13:12
well I can give people rights but only
13:14
works for calendars and it only works
13:17
because calendars support this rather
13:19
weird and a historic CalDAV protocol
13:22
that only works for calendars what's
13:24
wrong with this picture
13:25
should indeed work for everything should
13:26
if I shouldn't I be able to do that with
13:28
my contacts shouldn't I be able to do
13:30
that with my pictures I think there are
13:32
people all over the world who are
13:34
quietly at the moment frustrated by the
13:37
fact that you know they have friends on
13:40
Facebook and they have colleagues on
13:42
LinkedIn and they have photos on Flickr
13:44
and if they want to share the photos on
13:46
Flickr with their friends on Facebook
13:50
and with the friends on Facebook then
13:52
they have to upload the pictures to
13:54
facebook and if they want to share them
13:56
with people on LinkedIn and they have to
13:58
use LinkedIn and so they're actually
14:00
everybody in these silos so we've got
14:03
these silos our ability to share
14:05
information is very limited if I want to
14:09
share something if I want to allow my my
14:14
I delegate somebody to access some of
14:20
something at MIT then there are set of
14:22
people who have MIT certifiers they are
14:25
within the MIT system I can't give an
14:28
average you want to view if I want if
14:29
you want to look at photographs that I
14:31
got on the MIT system I can't use that
14:33
authentication system because you know
14:36
mi t--'s never going to give you a user
14:39
account in that space so I can't so I
14:41
can't use any of those facilities to
14:43
share apart from MIT well if you're
14:45
really sure that what you're building is
14:46
a silo and you want to build a HR system
14:48
which is really a silo then fine but
14:51
actually you know it turns out that when
14:53
I think when you look at most
14:54
organizations internally there is a
14:58
desperate lack of value there's some
15:01
missing opportunity from being able to
15:04
say oh no I
15:06
so that is health data I will share with
15:09
my doctor and I will share it with the
15:11
people in the ambulance who come to come
15:13
to rescue me when I'm dying in the
15:14
street
15:15
and also I want to share it with my
15:19
family these particular members of my
15:21
family even though they're in a
15:23
different country they're in a different
15:24
continent
15:25
they don't actually then never go to log
15:27
on to the same hospital system they have
15:29
a completely different hospital system
15:31
but I want to use their global identity
15:33
to give them access at all times to my
15:37
medical history and only those members
15:39
of the family not these members of the
15:40
family I want to be able to take
15:42
arbitrary people I want to be able to
15:44
say yeah I want to be able to sort out
15:48
my from for my medical history I'll
15:52
share with my family but the list of
15:54
appointments I have a doctor's really
15:56
important to share with my assistant
15:57
because she's the only one who guys
15:59
should control my calendar and so to set
16:01
up a reasonable life I need it so some
16:03
things need to be shared with some
16:04
people and so one of the things that
16:06
we're doing at MIT is a new project
16:09
called solid he's saying imagine if all
16:11
your later was like they calendar
16:14
imagine all the data was such that you
16:16
could store it in any store you could
16:18
store it in you could use any
16:22
application to use it because in fact
16:24
instead of having specific api's we're
16:26
saying we'll have one page generic API
16:28
which is just ability to read and write
16:30
structure to arbitrary structured data
16:32
and so in the solid system I can share
16:35
give you can give me your card
16:37
I can take your idea of it I can give
16:39
you access to anything I'm just in fact
16:43
we urinate I've found I just found we
16:48
found that we had a friend in common and
16:50
I could to this guy uses a solid system
16:53
I could give him access to the meeting I
16:57
just had with URI
16:58
so it's a these are exciting times that
17:01
we're breaking we're gonna break down
17:03
those walls between the between these
17:07
silos I think that you'll find where as
17:11
I might preach to people about breaking
17:13
gain down silos between the big social
17:16
networks and they're all people out
17:19
there my resonate you might look at your
17:21
company and realize actually the
17:23
divisions with my company all the
17:25
departments within my government
17:27
actually they behave pretty much like
17:29
you're talking about companies we know
17:31
we have we have our own silos never my
17:33
task being a silo we have our own
17:35
internal silence that's all or more
17:37
people say so I think it's exciting
17:39
times I think we are when we break down
17:41
the silos I think we're coming to we are
17:46
getting to a point where there is
17:47
actually enough frustration with privacy
17:50
not being respected
17:52
now frustration with me not being able
17:54
to use my own data myself that I think
17:56
we are ready for revolution and Orey
18:02
where where are you why'd you come out
18:03
here and let's let's talk about it with
18:06
these good people thanks for your
18:08
attention
18:19
swapping us out
18:21
[Music]
18:36
all right feech awesome hearing straight
18:41
from the source
18:42
so this morning I wanted to start off
18:45
with a little bit of a personal anecdote
18:48
it's kind of an embarrassing moment but
18:50
I'm used to being embarrassed on stage
18:52
so I'll just keep going in in 1991 I was
18:57
sitting in Lawrence Berkeley Lab with a
18:59
beautiful view of the Bay Area with my
19:01
next computer working on my on my
19:04
physics and I had a bunch of
19:05
applications on my desktop gopher and
19:08
other things that many in the room have
19:09
heard and others don't have any idea
19:11
about and this little application popped
19:15
up called a world wide web and I looked
19:18
at it and I don't understand this
19:20
clicked into it I was a theoretical
19:23
physicist there was a bunch of
19:25
experimental physics results from CERN
19:28
and I'm like okay this is another
19:30
attempt by the experimentalists to raise
19:32
their visibility and I hit delete I had
19:36
the lead at the world wide web
19:37
application for my desktop I didn't
19:39
realize the revolution that it just been
19:43
launched by the creator of that program
19:45
and all the infrastructure under that
19:47
and I think that's actually really
19:48
relevant for us today because you don't
19:50
realize revolutions when you're in them
19:53
when they're going when you're just in
19:55
the midst and everybody is contributing
19:57
without necessarily understanding that
19:59
and I thought we would kick off maybe
20:00
the the line of questions to Tim about
20:03
you know what was it like historically
20:06
and maybe we kind of shift a little bit
20:08
we've we've had a little bit of feedback
20:10
from the audience of questions are
20:11
really really interested in so I'll
20:15
adjust a little bit what we were going
20:18
to talk about maybe take a more a little
20:20
bit more historical route to help our
20:22
audience understand what did it take to
20:23
actually bring the web to life how did
20:27
this happen well deep frustration with
20:32
the existing situation I suppose I was I
20:36
did first degree with physics and in
20:40
physics I didn't use physics at CERN I
20:42
was a software engineer there
20:44
physicists are taught to generalize you
20:47
know you an Apple falls if I would if if
20:51
you drop an applet Falls if drop at the
20:52
end won't fall again if the rule is
20:54
there something we've got consistency is
20:58
there some rule there social setting
21:00
sent what I was looking at you put out
21:02
the generalization I'd look at all these
21:04
different documentation systems that
21:08
were running on different there were
21:09
many computers at CERN it was a
21:11
wonderful time for diversity in IT CERN
21:15
didn't have any big old military style
21:18
dictatorship over IT so all the
21:21
individual groups came from different
21:22
universities they bought brought
21:24
different
21:24
they brought different Macs and PCs
21:26
different people are different many
21:29
computers in different mate and then I
21:30
used the CDC new IBM mainframe so ever
21:33
everybody had a favorite system and
21:35
everybody wanted you to write your
21:38
docking documents in their favorite was
21:41
it word was it tech was was it st ml and
21:45
story on their favorite store and index
21:47
it was their favorite index and use
21:49
their favorite UI to get it and so there
21:52
was a dinner as I saw it a desperate
21:56
need for me just to be able to function
21:58
in the place I wanted to be able to have
21:59
all that stuff I wanted to be able also
22:01
I wanted to be a read write the idea was
22:03
it should be a read write space I wanted
22:06
students to come for the summer and be
22:08
able to just arrive and June look around
22:11
the web figure out understand what was
22:14
going on on set all the reasons but for
22:17
the decisions that have been made
22:18
contribute work hard for three months
22:21
adding in all their stuff into the web
22:23
and then leave without having to debrief
22:25
them because so that was they so that
22:28
was a sort of frustration to actually I
22:31
met I managed to get permission to do it
22:34
as a side project and then had to
22:36
persuade everybody was a good idea
22:38
lots of people like you went yeah but
22:40
it's a group of a surprising number of
22:44
people and and some rising number of
22:48
people on stage since sort of recounted
22:50
recalled with check on that moment but
22:52
the but in fact a very small number of
22:55
people did pick it up
22:56
that is all it takes in this group I can
23:00
tell you about those revolution and it
23:02
doesn't I don't need all of you I don't
23:05
need 90% of you to go and believe the
23:06
revolutions help with it all I needs a
23:08
few IPS sparkles in the in your eyes
23:12
okay and then a few people go home right
23:14
and say solid mit.edu check that out a
23:17
few people will then come to Reedy
23:20
centralize the web conferences and and
23:23
they may be small but then they're
23:24
passionate because they get it and there
23:26
are few people early on who got it
23:27
that's how it took off yeah so people
23:30
like Tony concert sack we're not very
23:32
far from you and I picked it up for it
23:33
right so so I think one of the really
23:36
brilliant things about this and it
23:37
really a lesson I would guess for the
23:39
audience is to pick your battles to say
23:42
you know there are certain things that
23:43
we do have to standardize but you didn't
23:45
go and tell everyone go and rewrite your
23:47
documents in this standard way you
23:49
basically said I will you know keep
23:52
going the direction that you're going
23:53
but follow a small number of protocols
23:56
and if you do that then the rest will
23:58
basically self-assemble how do you
24:00
decide what is good to standardize on
24:02
and what is okay to leave as is maybe in
24:05
your existing silos so I think the the
24:09
one would for the rule is universality
24:12
it should be able to work with
24:13
everything any computer system and so on
24:15
any language and he it should be
24:17
universal for people with accessibility
24:19
and so on so Universal team and it
24:22
should be able to work with any existing
24:23
system so what I thought was okay the
24:27
key thing is the name of the object the
24:31
now you call it a URL I call it you URI
24:34
but our Universal resource identifier is
24:38
the thing which starts off an HTTP and
24:40
ends with hash something that the idea
24:44
of that you have to give everything that
24:46
that is the one thing you have to do so
24:50
when it's a lot of them start easy to be
24:53
calm and those days HTTP colon now but
24:57
they don't have to and in fact one of
24:59
the things I think ok it's really
25:01
important that we can move on from HTTP
25:03
to the next thing on so what I'll do is
25:05
I'll put the skin on this scheme and the
25:07
code on and we'll put a CP now there but
25:10
actually
25:10
we'll also put an FTP car on an FTP will
25:13
be give you a way of making a URL
25:14
pointing into the hole of the existing
25:16
all these FTP shows so suddenly we
25:19
turned the Evan were all the existing
25:20
File Transfer Protocol servers into
25:22
things which could be addressed with
25:23
your eyes so we brought onboard all that
25:25
legacy stuff by folding FTP space into
25:28
the names by inventing way of making up
25:30
URL for any friend of thing on FTP and a
25:34
few other things seeing the gopher as
25:37
well so we put in the flexibility point
25:40
the idea is if the Cole on there that
25:42
flexibility point will allows us to
25:45
switch out HTTP in something else that
25:47
we did switch it out for HTTP and there
25:49
are lots of things like safe and ipfs
25:52
coming down the line that we can be we
25:54
can sort in there so the first thing is
25:56
yeah you do have to use your eyes but
26:00
you don't have to use HTTP you can go no
26:03
I will do our best design a good one and
26:05
when you use HTTP then you send down a
26:08
list of the client the browser sends
26:11
down a list of all the formats it
26:13
supports and they accept header is that
26:15
I accept these things and you can say
26:18
you could set all kinds of newfangled
26:19
things you don't have to do everything
26:21
with HTML directly negotiation that's
26:23
actually so that but so in HTTP middle
26:25
that there's a contact that there's a
26:27
negotiation so around one round-trip
26:29
said these are the things I accept and
26:31
then the server says ok I'm gonna give
26:33
it you in HTML I'm gonna give it to you
26:36
in audio if I get to give it you in PDF
26:38
and so already there was you don't have
26:42
to use a ste but if you do use a CP you
26:43
don't have to use HTML really you can
26:47
put it in and people did and people
26:49
still do and people and the Semantic Web
26:52
took off because we we said ok we just
26:55
add into the content negotiation say if
26:57
you if you can handle it if you're
26:59
looking for data then we've got we can
27:00
turn into these data formats we've got
27:02
hypertext and we've got link data they
27:05
and they are so they're equal things on
27:07
the web there's no the web has no bias
27:12
that you have to be doing HTML with it
27:14
so it's a great way segue to the next
27:16
step which at some point you realized
27:18
you know I need to actually inject
27:20
computer readable data over this web of
27:23
human readable
27:24
pages and you somehow managed to get
27:26
enough people to embed data to get this
27:29
idea going what do you think was was
27:31
important to get myself that's really
27:34
interesting
27:35
all right 2009 I did a TED talk getting
27:38
saying raw data now getting people I got
27:41
people jumping up and down and Ted
27:43
stadium saying raw data now because the
27:46
frustration there was yeah you'd go to a
27:49
government website you see the webpage
27:51
you download the PDF of the report and
27:53
in the PDF report there'd be this this
27:57
chart and actually what you wanted to do
27:59
you wanted pulled you wanted to pull the
28:01
data in a spreadsheet and so as a
28:03
journalist was a student knew I was a
28:05
scientist you couldn't do that so
28:07
usually publish the data you should
28:08
publish it in a sheet and machine
28:10
readable fashion and so that was a big
28:12
push to get people to publish data so
28:13
the open data movement was successful
28:16
partly because we got support from
28:17
Gordon Brown had lunch with him he said
28:20
yes what what should you do I said put
28:23
you get the government data online and
28:24
easily will do it ok yes and so the
28:27
usage just kind of did it much more
28:29
complicated story but long story short
28:32
UK did it you asked you cave of
28:34
competing to put government data on
28:36
corporate data also really really
28:38
important so there's been this to a
28:40
certain extent one of the things has
28:41
been the revolution and in open data and
28:46
if you look up the linked open data
28:47
cloud the lod cloud go google it look at
28:50
the way the linked open data cloud has
28:52
grown so that has partly been there's
28:54
been a huge amount of linked data that
28:56
you can in the public domain you can go
28:58
to and then meanwhile Google some of
29:01
folks at Google had been saying all the
29:04
data on the web will never work but
29:06
actually meanwhile with schema.org check
29:09
out scan with schema.org they started to
29:12
blog that well there's this way if you
29:13
if you put linked data into your into
29:18
your web page if you use things that
29:19
tools like RDF a that's RDF in in any
29:21
steam attributes or if a allows you to
29:24
you can publish a web page and you can
29:26
say oh by the way we're talking about a
29:27
product here and this is its price and
29:29
so on if you do that then we the Google
29:33
Center engine will not just put it into
29:35
index of documents they will put that in
29:37
index
29:38
products and then when they will do
29:40
compare they will set up your own
29:41
comparative shopping for you because
29:43
they will understand this is a product
29:45
so the value of the semantics it was so
29:48
much people so that meant that more than
29:50
a third of webpages I gather out there
29:52
at the moment but a few days have a few
29:56
years out of date
29:57
they have some sort of Semantic Web
29:59
compatible micro data in there that
30:01
Google scrapes out so that Google now
30:03
has so there's a huge incentive if you
30:06
want your stuff to appear you want your
30:09
search engine to know this product to
30:11
know where survey deliverables to and
30:13
from and what the prices and so on so
30:15
there's incentives so in fact now the
30:18
micro daters say there's a huge
30:20
explosion in that so there is a huge
30:22
amount of of semantic web data and you
30:25
can know you could tell the moment it
30:27
became important because the search
30:29
engine which remember all those search
30:31
engines used to just have a list of
30:33
things you'd such for Paris Hilton and
30:36
it will give you a list of webpages and
30:38
you'd see some of them will be about
30:40
Paris Hilton the person someone will be
30:43
about a Hilton in Paris and as a human
30:45
being you sort of pick one to follow
30:47
but then pretty soon but then with
30:49
Google then has this giant go global
30:51
grab of data and they put an info box
30:53
and info boxes are all Semantic Web
30:55
stuff okay they're saying ok we're
30:57
talking about a thing which is a hotel
30:58
that is of RDF type it is a hotel look
31:01
in schema.org this is a hotel and this
31:03
is a person this is a celebrity and we
31:05
have information about celebrity and
31:07
have information about the hotel and
31:08
we'll help you by will help you I'll
31:11
reserve a room in the hotel if you want
31:12
so the change people went back those
31:16
info boxes crept into the search box
31:18
that was a visible sign of really the
31:21
semantic way of having been so coming to
31:23
to becoming very powerful and we've been
31:26
active students of what made the web so
31:30
successful what made Semantic Web
31:31
successful because really our intent in
31:34
partnering with our customers is not to
31:36
build tomorrow's legacy but to actually
31:38
build long-lasting systems and put in
31:40
methodologies and put in approaches that
31:42
actually stand the test of time and I
31:44
think the ultimate one is actually the
31:45
web right they're the most complicated
31:47
system we've created so far that's
31:49
lasted us and grown and keeps innovating
31:51
on itself
31:53
I think one of the critical observations
31:54
that we made in in our conversations
31:57
backstage is this realization that when
32:00
you're thinking about data not only is
32:02
being exposed these days through api's
32:04
through through open data but also
32:07
thinking about it as a distributed graph
32:09
a decentralized graph of data that you
32:12
first need to actually surface it in a
32:15
in in a graph mind set so that you can
32:18
actually assemble a bigger graph out of
32:20
that I think that's absolutely critical
32:21
maybe share a little bit of your
32:22
thoughts on that
32:24
yes sure I suppose partly the laughs
32:27
might the reason why the semantic where
32:30
stuff was designed as a graph is because
32:33
not everything fits in a tree typically
32:35
if you took if you seek to treat tree
32:37
lay like XML sources and you merge them
32:40
together you ain't gonna see anymore
32:41
folks you know you can't just serialize
32:43
the result as XML you take two Jason
32:46
feeds you merge them together
32:48
you can't just serialize those out in
32:50
fact what you have to do is to build the
32:51
graph and then you realize the Gulf so
32:53
partly is because the graph model is the
32:57
most general you know all the relational
32:59
data entry everything can be mapped into
33:02
the graph when you're doing the
33:04
integration then you might pull in data
33:06
from little from all kinds of different
33:09
apps but then when you what is cool is
33:12
then when you put it into a graph then
33:13
you can use the graph query language to
33:16
be able to ask questions you could never
33:18
ask before you ask what the graph query
33:20
language is even though some of the data
33:22
came from rectangular database some of
33:24
it came from a tree shape thing some of
33:26
it came from all kinds of other other
33:28
shapes when you put it together it's
33:29
just a graph you couldn't ask a really
33:31
interesting insightful query which just
33:34
goes across those arcs of the graph no
33:37
matter where they came from and being
33:38
brings you out an insight and so some of
33:41
the really how people have scenes of
33:43
them to talk about they're really fun
33:46
times when they blew management minds
33:48
with with the system with when they took
33:51
a big cough triple store and the graph
33:56
query language and and then run queries
33:58
across it and put it into visualization
34:00
and suddenly what is people so look at
34:03
the company and what you know what's
34:05
going on here so
34:06
being able to be able to do work yeah
34:13
one mindset on were you working locally
34:15
with the data and putting other Minds
34:17
they don't when you're working with the
34:17
whole thing put phone right right and I
34:19
think you know if you if I follow kind
34:21
of the the dialogue you've been carrying
34:22
you start from realizing that there are
34:24
silos and rather than saying well let's
34:26
throw them out and let's rewrite
34:28
everything in a standard way you allow
34:30
those silos to be discovered by thinking
34:32
about them as nodes on graphs you come
34:34
up with some standard protocols to allow
34:36
people to at least discover and
34:38
communicate and negotiate how they get
34:40
that data and then I think the last step
34:42
in a sense is when that graph is open to
34:45
the right community you don't keep it
34:46
private but you actually open it maybe
34:48
it's to your internal developers maybe
34:49
it's you share it with some partners
34:51
maybe you make it truly open then the
34:53
question is one of innovation and again
34:55
you've advocated the direction of
34:56
permissionless innovation permissionless
34:59
access maybe talk to us a little bit
35:00
about how that's kept the web going all
35:02
these years the permission of space the
35:08
concept of a of a platform I was so I
35:12
the internet was invented back in 1969 I
35:15
was writing the memo about it because I
35:17
did have a thing like the web in 1989
35:20
for 20 years for 20 years the internet
35:24
had been built they've been built by
35:25
Vint Cerf and colleagues and they had
35:28
built it as a platform like what I mean
35:30
by a platform I mean something which is
35:32
solid something you should have got a
35:34
very well-defined
35:35
API at the the socket API which I argue
35:38
open a connection for one place on the
35:39
internet another place on the internet
35:40
without with information hiding about
35:43
all the gory details about how they
35:45
connected together so clean
35:47
straightforward answer and they didn't
35:50
think much of that we use this what
35:52
should this be usable for what should we
35:54
design this thing they said let's just
35:56
allow any two programs to communicate so
35:58
it didn't have an attitude a good
36:00
platform it doesn't have an attitude
36:01
about you're going to use it for so it's
36:04
it was decentralized there was no
36:06
central point where I had control where
36:08
I had to go and register the new
36:09
protocol I you had to I did have to pick
36:11
a TCP port number to use the client and
36:15
the server just had to agree on a port
36:16
number I picked two seven eight four
36:18
because that was my parents phone number
36:20
so at least I can remember and so that's
36:22
that's all the permission I have now we
36:24
know that came three centralized
36:26
development the web
36:27
similarly the the intent has been also
36:32
you don't have to ask me to make any
36:34
website just go ahead and do it really
36:36
do tomorrow and so you make any website
36:39
and you use the fact that we've got the
36:41
internet platform as one level the web
36:43
platform is another level they are both
36:44
just platforms they're just designed to
36:48
do the work do the do the donkey work of
36:52
connecting these things as we say and
36:54
and leave it up to your imagination to
36:57
decide what you're going to build on the
36:58
platform yep now what I think is
37:00
particularly interesting and I don't
37:02
know how intentional this was is that
37:03
when somebody adds their own thing to
37:06
the web permissionless on their own
37:09
motivation there's also enough structure
37:11
in there for other people to build on
37:13
the work that that first person is done
37:15
and you start to get these network
37:16
effects was that actually intentional in
37:19
the original design or did that is that
37:21
something you discovered later actually
37:23
it's really something we'll be talking
37:25
about there's two there's I will talk
37:31
about the key battles with ontology it's
37:32
at one point as well but I suppose the
37:35
there's a fork so did you did you plan
37:42
for people to be able to build on the
37:44
work that other people had pulled in and
37:46
kind of get this engine going I think
37:51
what are the interesting things that
37:53
happen there was the way the psychology
37:57
of the individual people worked with the
37:59
technology to make it spread so the
38:02
reason people were very excited about
38:04
the web back in the day back in the day
38:06
when the blogosphere was the word on
38:08
everybody steps when everybody was
38:09
blogging because this is what it was
38:11
like to blog okay you bought a computer
38:14
you
38:16
baura internet connection you bought the
38:18
software to run a web server and to run
38:21
the blog which isn't rocket science you
38:23
just had to have some they don't put
38:25
some HTML files and some folders and
38:27
then you write a blog and when you wrote
38:28
a blog you would link to other people's
38:30
blogs and you were trying to make your
38:33
blog as good as
38:34
possible and you try to link to really
38:36
really interesting dogs and you knew why
38:38
did you do that why was it why were
38:40
people trying so hard to make their blog
38:42
really really cool really really
38:45
interesting and linked to such good
38:47
stuff because they wanted other they
38:49
wanted people to read it they wanted two
38:51
things to have and they wanted other
38:52
people to read it they wanted a little
38:53
Google analytic kick counter at the
38:56
bottom pre Google Analytics even they
38:58
kick counter at the bottom to keep
39:00
rolling on they watch that people are
39:01
reading it because they just
39:02
psychological urges to be read and also
39:05
they wanted people to not only read it
39:06
to it they wanted people to link to it
39:07
because if people link to it then people
39:10
reading other blogs would come and that
39:12
would build up so they became a part
39:13
community of people who would link to
39:16
each other's blogs if and only if they
39:18
were really good and so there was a
39:20
feeling that everybody was working to
39:22
make the blogosphere just a more and
39:24
more interesting place and about higher
39:25
and higher quality place and that was
39:28
the way the psychology of people need to
39:31
be read and the mechanics of the link
39:33
worked and I think there's a lot of
39:35
lessons here for organizations in trying
39:38
to say you know have you thought through
39:40
the incentives of individuals there are
39:42
individual personal motivations is there
39:44
something in there that for example if
39:46
you want to effect massive
39:47
organizational change and you want to do
39:49
that by by having everyone kind of play
39:52
in one direction what is their incentive
39:53
to actually do that if there is an
39:55
incentive if there's a reward system if
39:57
you want people to be consumption
39:59
oriented right so that they care about
40:01
the consumption and their incentives are
40:03
about that and guess what you get a very
40:05
consumer friendly structure even inside
40:07
of your of your delicious you've got the
40:10
the consumer incentive is aligned with
40:12
producing the overall wonderful it's
40:14
August Fair all the wonderful just like
40:16
what the wonderful Wikipedia then the
40:20
flip example is suppose you make so
40:23
again you make with all the best
40:24
intentions you say let's we want people
40:26
to be able to to try to use all the data
40:32
we've got about our users to be able to
40:33
make very very good target decisions in
40:35
targeting the ads we want the ads to be
40:37
very efficient don't we want them to be
40:38
the sort of things which really appeal
40:39
to users because for users we don't want
40:43
that space to be wasted space we want
40:44
the ads bar to be something which is
40:46
full of
40:46
useful ideas and so we will make the
40:50
targeted advertising system is efficient
40:51
as possible what could go wrong and we
40:54
will make it available to sue anybody
40:57
who wants to sell products and why and
40:59
why shouldn't we make it out of a old
41:01
somebody wants to sell a product if that
41:02
product is a political political idea or
41:05
a political party and so in fact you can
41:08
build it with all the net best
41:09
intentions you can build a system which
41:10
actually maybe we'll find out
41:12
turns out we decreed to be something
41:15
which democracy can't take you know in
41:18
France you're not allowed to advertise
41:20
if your political party period in the UK
41:24
you're not allowed to advertise on TV if
41:26
you're a political party okay because TV
41:29
was felt to be too powerful and too
41:31
manipulative and you can't and anyway
41:35
you've got it's no good if you allow
41:36
physical speech to be bought with
41:39
dollars it should be given in equal
41:42
quantities to each candidate
41:43
so there's a whole perk so if you go
41:45
along that way you know you could
41:46
imagine we should now cook go back to
41:49
social networks and say actually in
41:51
future just for the sake of democracy to
41:55
preserve democracy we have to turn off
41:57
your system because it has ended up
41:59
producing a horrible polarized world in
42:02
which people are horribly distrustful of
42:05
each other and so there's a so when
42:09
you're building a really narrow system
42:11
that scales to it to billions of people
42:12
watch out for the unintended consequence
42:15
it's not as simple it's really
42:17
complicated to to understand how these
42:20
systems maybe will spend the last minute
42:22
and a half if you can talk to us a
42:24
little bit about where the World Wide
42:25
Web foundation is actually going right
42:27
there's World Wide Web has such a
42:29
profound effect on our lives that I
42:32
think you've you've been heavily
42:34
invested in also trying to help it go in
42:36
in a better direction make sure people
42:38
have access let me tell us a little bit
42:40
about that so the web foundation came
42:42
out of the realization among the tech
42:44
crowd that I was with that oh my
42:46
goodness twenty twenty percent of the
42:48
world are using this thing you know wow
42:51
isn't that cool became very quickly uh
42:54
what about the other eighty percent so
42:57
there's a really part of the realization
42:58
was that
43:00
well when you make the web even more
43:05
cool when you make the search engine
43:06
even more powerful and so then for the
43:09
20% yeah fine you're making him up
43:12
waffles say you're increasing the
43:13
digital divide so to a certain extent
43:15
you're making the world a worse place
43:16
since you're making it more an equal
43:18
place so the web foundation was about
43:20
two pieces it was about what about the
43:23
other 80% so the web foundation is about
43:26
access it's about how can we try to get
43:28
at a moment we're talking about 1/4 to
43:30
which you should be able to get a
43:32
gigabyte of mobile data for less than 2%
43:38
of your income so that's in some
43:41
countries like Nigeria like they've
43:43
actually got there about a lot of
43:45
countries so we put so that is about
43:48
access but it's also meanwhile we
43:51
realized that we couldn't just for the
43:53
people who have got access we can't rest
43:55
on our laurels and ticking off the last
43:59
couple of years and look back job well
44:01
done
44:02
ok the only thing we had to do I used to
44:05
say to people you can't use the web for
44:07
99 percent of your life but for the
44:09
other 1% you have to fight for net
44:11
neutrality because it all depends on and
44:13
you know we use that platform and that
44:15
platform uses that powerful but for 1
44:17
percent of your life you have to fight
44:18
for the openness of that platform where
44:20
it turns out you have to fight for a lot
44:21
more than that one
44:23
we fight for we fought for no new jersey
44:25
and we got named charity and whatever
44:27
happened to that so we have to go back
44:30
and feet from the ground again
44:31
boring but yeah boring but true you have
44:34
to go back and in this country you have
44:36
to go down in Washington you and and if
44:38
right now call your Congressman about
44:41
noisy whoever thought we'd have to do
44:42
that but it's not just in Charles of
44:45
course with all kinds of other things
44:46
there are all kinds of facts to the web
44:51
there are surveillance there is
44:54
surveillance which for example in the UK
44:55
the UK première says just decided that
44:59
it's more important that the police can
45:01
spy on can have the ISPs track the track
45:06
your web traffic than it is personal
45:08
privacy although more important than the
45:11
fear that all your lists of all the web
45:13
traffic the people
45:14
your family have gone should become
45:15
public so the lots of things so there's
45:17
also such a fight we had a campaign
45:19
called where we where we want which is
45:21
men got ask people about what sort of
45:24
web do we one that was around the 25th
45:27
anniversary of the web folks were coming
45:30
up next year to the 30th anniversary of
45:32
that memo at same time that's the 20% of
45:38
the people having web actually it is now
45:40
becoming forty nine point nine nine nine
45:42
nine nine what's-his-face people are on
45:44
the web in some time in November do
45:48
become part of the sir of the
45:50
celebration this sort of well I think
45:52
we're gonna have a celebration as we
45:53
flip over that to fifty percent of the
45:56
people on the web at the same time more
45:59
or less will be celebrating and then a
46:01
few months after that we're celebrating
46:03
that the thirtieth birthday of the web
46:06
and we need to celebrate it by really
46:08
launching a huge efforts to protect it
46:11
when we never realized that at the 30th
46:13
birthday point we would have to put so
46:15
much effort to protecting the pieces so
46:17
we're 50/50 point mean to work on access
46:20
for that fifty percent and the web that
46:22
we want a real open web are we want our
46:26
kids and our grandkids to develop for
46:28
the other heart that's a great going
46:30
message please join me in thanking Sir
46:32
Tim berners-lee
46:39
but thank you for joining us
46:43
that's why foundation people yes thank
46:46
you very much
