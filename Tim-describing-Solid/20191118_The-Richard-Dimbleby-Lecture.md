33:20 This gives users complete control of their data. It does that by decoupling the data from the applications. 

33:30 It's still the web, but the web with a few more things added and a few assumptions overturned.

33:36: We add a ? identity system so that instead of having to sign in to everything with Google and Facebook you can sign in with your favourite Solid provider and you won't be tracked.  

33:45 We add ubiquitous sharing control so that you can share anything with anybody no matter which social media they happen to be part of. 

32:48 Also with a Solid account you get some storage. A sort of personal cloud storage. A USB storage in the sky. We call is a Solid Pod. A space that is yours. All the data in it you control. 

34:14 And here's how we flip some of the assumptions about the way that apps work at the moment. When you start a Solid app, instead of the app storing the data itself, it stores it on your Pod. When you use the app, you choose which app to use, and you choose which Pod to use, and then because all of the data goes into your Pod, or various Pods, then you have complete control of your data because that's the way Pods work, they allow you to share anything with anything. 

33:50 It starts off about privacy but what's exciting to most people is creating a world where you are empowered to share anything with anybody without worrying which social network they are on, for example. 

33:54 You may see the web as just a took, something you don't think about, you don't question, you don't have any control of at all. But there you're wrong. Even though you may think that way, every one of you here has been part of creating the web. Every time you make links, every time you post or like a photo
