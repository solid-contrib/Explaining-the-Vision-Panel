“The idea of Solid is that we separate the apps from the data storage.

So, it’s as though when you take, suppose you take a roll of film on your camera and you (“roll of film” as we call it) and it says where do you want to upload this film to. And you have a choice. So, at that moment you can, so for example your camera might say: do you want to put your film in Dropbox? do you want to put it in Google drive? Do you want to put it on your home computer? Do you want to put it on the computer at work where you’re doing that project?

In Solid we call each of these places where you have got a place to store data a ‘Pod’. You can think of it as a personal online data store, but it’s just Pod. Pod works.

You can have a personal Pod, you can have a work Pod.

Your work, for example, my decide, the Washington Post may decide we’re going to use lots of really cool Solid apps. You want to use Solid apps just for your development work, for your review work, if you want to work together on your articles of Solid, go ahead. But,  all of your data must be stored on the Washington Post Solid Pod because we want to mange security and because we want to manage the back up, we want to manage the posterity of it so we’ve got a copy of it. So as long as you use the Washington Post Solid Pod you can use all kinds of Solid apps.

And in particular you can use all those ones branded as beneficent apps, one of the neat things down the road.

In fact we were talking about the push to. Fake news has phenomenally pushed a lot of people to decide that they wanted to pay a journalist, to make news, to figure out what’s going on. So they signed up, so they got subscriptions. Things like the Washington Post, the Guardian, places where people do serious journalism. And meanwhile the assumption is that any app they use on the internet is going to abuse them, the assumption is that any app is going to be just mining their data and manipulating them. So, with Solid you will have access to huge amounts of data. In a Solid world you will have access to lots of different types of data, you will have access to all your financial data because of open banking. There will be open health. You will have access in fact to a lot more data about yourself than Amazon even has now because you will know all the things you bought and Amazon only knows the things you bought for data. So you will have so much access to so much data, that you can then, it is very, very, beneficial for you to run programs which allow you to run your life to figure out what to give the kids for birthdays, to figure out where to take that vacation. You’ll be able to run very powerful programs and you will pay. You will want to pay someone to write them. You will want to pay a community, or maybe you will get an open source community to publish programs.

But, these programs which are beneficent, if they have the beneficent brand then the idea is, it’s like a journalist, they have taken the Hippocratic Oath, I am writing this app for the benefit of the user, that works for the user. So when I am using this app I will know there will not be any advertising. If it stores data, it stores data in order to help me. So that’s a massive change. Solid is going to be a ubiquitous data storage system which will give people complete control of their data. Beneficent apps are one of the things, one of the movements I hope we will see because I want to see it. I’m going to write some and I’m going to use them, and one of the things I’m going to enjoy doing is making sure that my kids and grandkids are using live in a world where I’ve paid for apps that they use that do not abuse them because I can do that. So that’s the Solid idea and that’s what keeps me sitting up.”
