[Original recording of talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxqko96C5ZI)

00:13
great to be here my first try fork so
00:18
yep so I've got two so I got two
00:21
sessions and this one I'm it's going to
00:24
be if you like the high level and
00:26
tomorrow morning then I'm going to talk
00:28
more go down in two more details about
00:31
particularly in the new project I've got
00:33
the solidly the the project called solid
00:36
so this one past present and future
00:41
this is going to be looking back this is
00:43
looking at the state of the web at the
00:45
moment and looking about what
00:49
resolutions if you like about the future
00:54
so yes the next computer was in fact a
00:59
really year critical part of the dormant
01:03
of the wherever I should put it in
01:04
context I suppose to really put it in
01:08
context for me I grew up I was born in
01:10
1955 so when I was when I was small my
01:14
well my parents actually met both
01:18
working on the earliest stood digital
01:21
computers they worked on the Ferranti
01:23
mark 1 which is the earliest computer in
01:25
the UK my mom programmed it my dad
01:28
helped to sign it and there was just a
01:32
little tin hat on the end of that there
01:34
was a big Ferranti electronics guy
01:37
factory in of it that there was a little
01:39
tin hat in that scene hat they built the
01:41
computer and various people met other
01:43
turns out my parents for two was
01:45
forgotten got together and they produced
01:47
me and so I gather that early on for
01:55
example at one point my mother went to a
01:58
client can be somebody who installed one
02:00
of the community's Marquand computers
02:01
and when I was actually in utero which
02:05
and so she was with some caller the
02:08
first computer the commercial community
02:10
bank programmer because she she actually
02:13
sold it to a commercial company sillas
02:16
that was exciting
02:17
those were very exciting times and I
02:20
suppose I grew up
02:22
in this spirit the spirit of the
02:27
imitation game if you like the other the
02:29
imitation game is about ensuring this
02:33
discovery that if you think about it if
02:36
a computer is a computer worth its salt
02:38
if a computer is a computer which can
02:40
compute at all then your computer can
02:43
emulate my computer and therefore
02:45
because one compute the other they can
02:49
both do the same thing if you put can
02:52
program yours to do something then I can
02:53
program mine to do it because I can if
02:55
necessary just program mine to emulate
02:57
your computer and I can run in your
02:59
program on my emulator and therefore all
03:01
computers are equivalent and therefore
03:03
if all computers recover and the things
03:06
you do that are limited only by your
03:09
imagination they're not limited by the
03:11
computer so that was the really exciting
03:15
spirit in which I grew up so my parents
03:17
are mathematicians at the time so I go
03:20
up there wasn't any computer science so
03:23
I went to Oxford and physics and they
03:26
got to play with some computers I got
03:27
fallen off their computer foot using it
03:30
for inappropriate things so great urge
03:33
to build with my own one I did build my
03:34
own when I got when the 6800 chip came
03:36
out I was lucky that I was of the age so
03:40
that at the point when I was so I was my
03:45
getting through my teenage years and
03:47
starting to get more serious about my
03:48
projects and I got the point where I
03:50
could I knew how to build a computer if
03:53
necessary out of transistors or out of
03:55
gates and gates came along then the chip
03:58
came along so I rode the wave of the
04:02
microprocessor revolution because I
04:03
built my own computer
04:04
I also succeeded chip that's two two
04:07
inch long CPU rest of the thing around
04:11
it and so I ended up doing becoming a
04:14
consultant but for various places
04:16
discovered Geneva I think some of you
04:19
guys hang out in Geneva I got some work
04:21
in souk in cantaloupe hindenburg and
04:25
calm and places like that and so I went
04:29
and was available in general to help
04:32
people figure out how to build systems
04:34
using
04:35
using come using microprocessors instead
04:41
of using computers instead of hardware
04:43
hmm so that was how I ended up at CERN
04:46
CERN just had a call we need bright
04:49
people who help we have underestimated
04:50
how long it takes to build a control
04:54
system so I felt first went out to CERN
04:56
in fact in 1980 because I think great
05:00
place if you haven't who who has been to
05:04
CERN you have to hold up your hand as
05:06
well as using the app because I don't
05:08
have that helpful from that not very
05:10
many of you you all should go it's
05:11
really exciting it's great place
05:12
what was it writing about it then was
05:15
apart from the fact they had they were
05:17
building these huge machines had this
05:19
huge projects and doing and they're
05:21
pushing forward the boundary of physics
05:23
what was exciting about it also was that
05:26
it was a very heterogeneous very high
05:31
level lots of intellectual level but
05:34
these people came to build a expect
05:39
these his experiments from all over and
05:42
they came from different universities
05:43
and they use completely different
05:45
computer systems and in fact so when you
05:47
look back but I went to writing in 1980
05:50
I went back as a fellow in 1984 and when
05:54
I was at that point if you'd looked
05:58
around CERN you'd have found there two
06:00
competing mainframe computers you'd have
06:02
had the CDC machine and IBM machine but
06:05
lots of many computers had just arrived
06:07
and people were starting to use Macs and
06:09
PCs some typical physicists would have a
06:13
UNIX workstation on their desk and so
06:16
you've got these UNIX machines you've
06:17
got back for ms operating systems you've
06:19
got the old mainframe lots and lots of
06:22
different operating systems then and
06:24
each those operating systems had its own
06:28
documentation system its own help
06:30
systems its own manual systems and so
06:33
they were all completely and internal
06:35
but okay so this is 1989 so when I
06:39
arrived at CERN 99 that was 20 years
06:42
after 1969 when the internet was
06:46
invented by Vint Cerf
06:48
and so on alright so I'm at CERN but the
06:51
Internet has been invented 20 years ago
06:52
it wasn't really it wasn't a policy in
06:57
Europe to use the internet because it
06:59
wasn't a national standard in 1989 just
07:03
getting to the point that it spread
07:05
throughout America and so if I decided I
07:07
wanted to use it that he was becoming
07:11
politically acceptable the the story I
07:16
think the the my favorite bits of it of
07:22
the stories the role that my boss Mike
07:24
central played I was in the physics lab
07:28
I was hanging on people what we we
07:30
should build this light in this global
07:32
hypertext system if we just write a
07:34
little bit of code on top of each of the
07:36
existing documentation systems we could
07:38
write a shim layer to adapt them to a
07:42
universal space like one big Bundy book
07:46
and a lot of people nobody said really
07:48
understand and understood what it'd be
07:50
like but Mike in fact he had a twinkle
07:54
in his eye and his soul his solution to
07:58
this problem which he's well never mind
08:01
the high project the Globex project but
08:04
let's do what we let's try out the next
08:07
machine Steve Jobs had just produced a
08:09
next computer there's really cool back
08:12
development and system back mainly in
08:15
cube with some fins on it looked a bit
08:17
like a sort of a cost me a motorbike and
08:19
a and a pile of vinyl records it had a
08:24
very cool colonel it has very cool new
08:28
optical discs it had also a very cool
08:35
develops environment with the with a
08:38
user interface builder so we had a
08:40
graphical user interface builder for
08:42
graphic building graphical user
08:44
interfaces and so that was worth you
08:46
know that was worth there's really
08:48
competing department Mike said we you
08:50
know you you're interesting why don't we
08:53
buy it why we test it out let's test the
08:55
development environment and if you want
08:58
a test environment development
08:59
environment
09:00
you will need a program to test it on so
09:04
pick a program any program why not that
09:08
hypertech's thing you've been talking
09:09
about so he had a twinkle in his eye and
09:12
when he unfortunately he diagnosed with
09:16
cancer at that point and he died about
09:19
ten years later but and his wife Peggy
09:22
when she went through his things she
09:24
discovered the copy of the memo that I
09:26
wrote and in the corner in his writing
09:30
on the front cover in the top right he
09:33
had written vague but exciting and so
09:38
thank goodness otherwise if he thought
09:42
it was exciting the vague then he maybe
09:46
wouldn't have let me get the next
09:47
machine so I got the next machine we
09:49
wrote the code it took about two months
09:51
to actually get the first web browser
09:52
working I had the work have the web
09:54
server running on the same machine the
09:56
web server all the the web code you know
09:58
if you your technical people you know
10:00
that it's really simple the whole you
10:02
know basically the web design is really
10:04
simple just URLs are just like you know
10:07
these things that start with HTTP colon
10:08
they're just like file names with a bit
10:11
a D on the web server isn't very much
10:14
wasn't very much code I try to make
10:17
everything look I try to make everything
10:22
look like other protocols that people
10:24
seen I tried to make HTML look like as a
10:27
version of SGA now the markup language
10:30
they use on the mainframe so the people
10:32
who made their documents um mainframe
10:34
would look at it and think oh yeah I can
10:35
do that and I made the GDP looked like
10:37
smtp and nntp and ftp do all the other
10:41
transfer protocols that were already out
10:44
there on the net and i tried to sort of
10:47
get people in excited about it i thought
10:52
i wrote the code in 1990 by the time I
10:55
got 1994 I had realized that I had to
10:59
the states end result was fun nice
11:02
wonderful wonderful to be Switzerland
11:03
great view of the Alps but CERN itself
11:06
didn't know how to start an industry
11:08
consortium MIT did they might he did in
11:11
Riya
11:12
the lab in France did and so the
11:15
question was formed with two legs one in
11:17
France one in Rio went in at MIT we
11:22
later we now have house legs in in China
11:28
and Japan as well and so at that point I
11:32
had to had to move to the states as well
11:34
because the internet had spread only in
11:37
the States
11:38
really so because the internet hadn't
11:40
really been endorsed by the European
11:43
community with a small see the web has
11:48
spread over there and so if you like at
11:52
that point if you look at people on a
11:57
Bob said team I've never been on a
12:00
bobsled team but it looks as though
12:01
first of all you've all that you know
12:04
the first job is you have to you have to
12:06
push this thing and you push it and you
12:08
push it and you push it in a certain
12:09
point it gets faster and faster and this
12:11
is a really crucial point we should get
12:13
in and steer and then and then and 1994
12:17
really would or maybe 1993 with that
12:20
point for the World Wide Web I had to
12:21
get in and steer people are involved in
12:23
it wanted to people who were working for
12:27
the computer companies where they hadn't
12:29
really said anything publicly like
12:31
Digital Equipment Corporation had maybe
12:33
one public-facing web server but
12:38
actually 50 inside the firewall
12:39
everybody was setting up web servers
12:42
everybody starting to play with this
12:43
technology so they said we want to be
12:45
involved in in keeping it one way and so
12:48
that the crucial thing I think the thing
12:52
I got right about the web and if you're
12:54
working on web technology should trying
12:56
to maintain us it was Universal the
13:00
crucial thing was it the design I looked
13:04
at all these different systems that the
13:07
documentation systems and whatever new
13:10
documentation systems people had
13:12
produced they always ended up basing it
13:17
on one particular technology
13:25
they would say you know you have to use
13:30
ft ml or you have to use UNIX or you
13:32
have to use Microsoft Word or or you
13:35
have to store it on a UNIX machine and
13:37
and in fact he realized that the web had
13:38
to be universal
13:39
it had to be universal any hardware and
13:41
software any operating system had to
13:46
work with any culture at the time we
13:48
didn't have Unicode Unicode wasn't the
13:50
thing but there was but there was ISO
13:53
Latin one was the best I wish would work
13:57
for the European countries but and so
13:59
later on the web consortium moved
14:01
everything to unique of course
14:02
everything you see everything you should
14:04
you should be in Unicode and everything
14:06
now I designed
14:08
utf-8 so Universalis universality
14:11
universality and that universality of
14:13
the technology meant that it ended up
14:16
spreading the fact that it had been
14:18
designed so that you could put anything
14:21
on the web because the power of the
14:24
hypertext link is that it can when you
14:26
make a link when you write a blog when
14:28
you make a thing you can making you can
14:30
point to anything then this technology
14:35
which allowed you to put anything on the
14:36
web ended up with pretty much putting
14:39
people book kind of everything all the
14:42
way so there's a lot of stuff got put on
14:44
the web and that in the early days when
14:46
people got online because I didn't
14:48
understand and that it was a that it was
14:51
a web without borders they would people
14:54
would get spend all night and the
14:58
computer ticking over the sourah and the
15:00
ticking of the phone line and and
15:03
surfing web surfing going we Wow and to
15:11
a certain extent there was a disease
15:12
people got that they fell away because
15:14
there was you could put anything out
15:16
there they've had say I had to read
15:17
everything but then afterwards then that
15:21
then and now the new generation
15:24
arrives and realize that actually you
15:27
don't just find that everything's out
15:29
there you don't have to read it all in
15:31
fact the
15:33
but in fact behind that it was actually
15:35
a really interesting philosophy which
15:40
for a while I had to explain to people
15:42
they would say to me Tim there's bad
15:43
stuff on the web and I say yeah I mean
15:47
the the web is humanity if you go on the
15:50
web you will find good stuff and you'll
15:51
find bad step you will find him and see
15:53
just read the good stuff I just not like
15:56
email it's not like spam which people
15:58
fail at you you have to your always
16:01
reduce to read the good stuff and that
16:03
philosophy seems very logical ok it when
16:08
you just you just live your life so that
16:12
you read stuff that you feel makes sense
16:18
you enjoy which you can use that to read
16:22
live your life and to play into work and
16:26
what could go wrong well what could go
16:31
wrong is that we rediscover a couple of
16:35
years ago that well I'm happy and you
16:38
are all happy maybe all the following
16:41
links between the same between these
16:43
websites which are very scientifically
16:45
based and ignore and just not worrying
16:47
about the fact all that exists because
16:49
that's all that's that stuff that exists
16:51
doesn't hurt us well while we are doing
16:56
that meanwhile the stuff doesn't exist
16:58
and also there are a large number of
17:00
people who read it and there are a lot
17:04
of other people who believe it and they
17:07
vote that is the problem ok so the web
17:13
foundation if you after the trump rex
17:16
elections and cambridge analytic her and
17:18
everything came down the web foundation
17:21
were first thing we did was to blog to
17:23
say whoa Micke mid-course correction we
17:26
have been keeping it free and open we
17:27
have been assuming that keeping it free
17:29
and open will be all we need to do
17:30
actually we need to do we need to do
17:33
more stuff it's not just about keeping
17:35
you free and open if the web is to serve
17:38
humanity it's also got to be net a
17:42
constructive site it
17:45
gotta be now something which provost
17:47
produces truth more than fiction that it
17:51
produces as a basis for democracy as he
17:55
saw Marcus he depends on facts people
17:58
knowing stuff about the world in fact
18:00
depending on science and the way people
18:02
find out about the facts and and now the
18:06
web has got a large part to do with that
18:08
print process on the web has been
18:09
serving a lot of people fake stuff so so
18:14
I think a lot of people with and the lot
18:16
of people the well foundation in general
18:20
with me decide every decided okay we
18:23
need to address this it's no we've been
18:25
fighting for net neutrality we mean
18:27
making sure that that internet platform
18:31
itself is free and open to everybody
18:32
making the travel web platform built on
18:35
top of the Internet it's free and open
18:38
and open for anybody to creat whatever
18:39
they want but now we have to actually
18:41
look at what people are really doing we
18:42
have to look up the platforms we have to
18:44
look at the things like Reddit and
18:46
Twitter and Facebook where people are
18:47
actually doing the politics and fun and
18:51
look at and find ways of measuring we
18:54
never thought that was our business but
18:55
now we realize that if you're concerned
18:57
about the web serving humanity it you do
19:00
have to make it your business and so
19:04
that was a sort of a reckoning so there
19:08
are of the web seems to me he started
19:11
off almost thirty years ago with this
19:14
sort of meteoric rise mission Rises a
19:18
bit crazy because actually meters come
19:20
down so somebody's meteoric career I've
19:26
always know I thought was a funny phrase
19:28
nobody so there but it was a glistening
19:31
excited rise it started off with John
19:34
Perry Barlow writing you could look at
19:38
his manifesto for cyberspace which says
19:39
when we are all connected with
19:41
technology then we will figure
19:43
everything out we know we will we won't
19:44
need laws you don't need countries so
19:47
very Lenin esque sort of imagine there's
19:50
a world without any countries because on
19:53
cyberspace actually there aren't any
19:55
countries so we've got one
19:57
so bingo well and so there was a lot of
20:00
excitement really took off then and then
20:02
and now it's used to control place where
20:05
it could be it's heading you for
20:08
potentially very dystopian situation
20:12
with all sorts of nasty stuff going down
20:14
a lot of heat crime a lot of bullying a
20:17
lot of state news a lot of manipulation
20:20
of electorates all kinds of the lists of
20:23
things which are going wrong on the web
20:26
is huge I think for a while babs back
20:30
here people were a bit worried about
20:32
privacy
20:33
the main thing if you ask people what
20:36
we're seeing and what were the issues
20:37
with the web well they say well the
20:38
problem with the web is it's great but
20:41
you do people that consumers do a deal
20:43
with the devil consumers do a deal with
20:45
the devil because they the only reason
20:49
that they can get it free and it's so
20:51
good they need it and they but they
20:52
couldn't afford otherwise and so what
20:54
they do is that they give away all their
20:55
personal data and that personal data is
20:58
monetized and abused and by the big
21:02
companies and then it's because it's
21:05
that that data is sold by the big
21:07
companies that that they can get to use
21:10
things for free and so in fact there was
21:14
a big question mark around that there
21:16
were some look at the blogs which
21:17
pointed out actually if you do the do
21:20
the math working out the data the
21:23
monetizable data value of the family's
21:25
personal leader it's actually it's less
21:27
than what they pay for internet access
21:29
so if instead they paid for the services
21:32
instead of instead of the company being
21:36
getting paid by monetizing and if when
21:38
you look at that also when you look at
21:40
for example Facebook actually you know
21:41
Facebook's business model isn't selling
21:43
data it's advertising and it's and if
21:46
you want to advertise it's very good
21:48
based advertising because the targeted
21:50
advertising is brilliantly effective if
21:52
you want to advertise to a particular
21:54
group then you don't waste or people's
21:58
time you don't waste your using other
21:59
users time you don't you find people
22:02
rapidly very effectively and so really
22:05
the Facebook isn't that they sell data
22:07
is that they do targeted advertising
22:09
through
22:10
whew there are some interesting papers
22:12
people have written about how if you
22:15
have a world which is only driven by
22:17
advertising then the the you will end up
22:23
necessarily having companies which end
22:26
up just being trained by the advertising
22:29
machine just being trained trained like
22:31
a dog to know to perform because
22:33
advertising a machine will give them
22:35
more money if they get their users to
22:38
engage okay if you get their users to
22:40
not to what the users trying to do but
22:43
do something else and buy something they
22:46
didn't need if you can get the user to
22:48
do that then you get money and so
22:51
companies get trains get money people
22:52
developers out there get trained to draw
22:55
a person in Venice Macedonia learned to
22:59
learn to put out actually fake headlines
23:03
work better
23:05
during the Trump elections they just
23:07
found it wasn't that they were trying to
23:08
upset the election response they found
23:10
that putting things like Hillary wanted
23:13
can move wanted Trump to win that was
23:16
one of the best people for what and the
23:19
case so strange it's a strange world I
23:26
don't I think now we realize but
23:29
actually the world doesn't have to be
23:30
like that
23:31
view people are technical people right
23:35
you make things when you look at
23:37
something like when my parents look to
23:41
those first computers you know they knew
23:42
they could should be ever coded to do
23:44
anything all right when you look at a
23:46
computer now most of the people out
23:47
there when they open a computer it's
23:50
like a fridge
23:51
it's a white thing they look at it and
23:53
say hey and you know it's like the
23:56
fridge if doesn't have enough nice
23:57
things in it they don't buy stuff and
23:59
they put him with nice apps but they
24:01
don't think of it as a programmable
24:03
thing that you do when you open a
24:05
computer in your cleaners and and if
24:08
that's something which where you can
24:10
imagine it being different if you
24:12
measure being better than you can go out
24:13
and code it that's fine it's this
24:16
realization that you have lots of people
24:18
don't but this is Wayne teaching lots
24:19
and lots of people to code partly
24:21
because they realize
24:23
possibility partly so that they don't
24:24
take stuff for granted so we need people
24:27
really lawyers we need people in
24:31
Parliament who understand this about
24:34
technology too but so you couldn't so
24:36
you look at this when you look at her
24:37
computer you can if you don't have the
24:40
apps you could write new apps and you
24:42
also realize when you look at something
24:44
like a social network some guy wrote
24:47
that for wrote that social network and
24:52
somebody because somebody wrote the
24:53
social network that means that they
24:57
could change it you could write another
24:59
one you can if you worry about a social
25:02
network you wonder about whether in fact
25:06
it may be it promote it isn't very
25:12
constructive isn't a place where it's
25:13
where place where if people express
25:16
hatred that hatred so it builds up where
25:18
as a suppressed laugh that I've dies out
25:20
or doesn't build up as much as a hatred
25:21
for example you can then you could look
25:25
at and think maybe just changing the
25:28
color of the light buttons maybe just
25:30
moving changing the way the retweet
25:32
works maybe just changing the way the
25:35
reddit but up and down buttons can be
25:37
used by people who have less and more or
25:39
less kudos or something will actually
25:42
create a completely new world so I I
25:45
think it's really important things to
25:47
learn from this is that we've got that
25:53
an opportunity to look at all the social
25:57
networks we use and to imagine you once
26:01
what the web foundations just come up
26:03
with recently the way I was at the web
26:05
summit in Lisbon a few days ago and
26:08
there we announce one the web foundation
26:13
response to some of these issues a bunch
26:16
of these issues in fact so we said the
26:19
Reformation says we need a contract for
26:22
the web because my contract well we've
26:27
had manifestos we've had all kinds of
26:30
things for the web we've had before but
26:35
now
26:36
why contract for the web contract is
26:38
about different people putting in
26:39
different things and so the contract for
26:42
the web means recognizes the fact that
26:46
people individuals need to behave in
26:51
certain ways and governments need to
26:54
behave in certain ways and corporations
26:56
need to behave in certain ways and if
26:59
everybody behaves in certain ways if we
27:02
figure out what does it take for a
27:04
government to what is it what does
27:07
agency need to do what regulations do
27:09
you need to remove or to put in what can
27:13
what best practices do you want
27:14
companies to be able to do so you've got
27:17
governments companies and individuals
27:20
all have their own roles you as an
27:22
individual you have a role in the web
27:24
contract too partly to behave trying to
27:30
be part of the truth system parts down
27:34
help with Wikipedia their help with B
27:37
make sure that you don't retweet things
27:40
unless you if you just cuz it makes you
27:42
mad just don't retweet it unless you
27:44
check that it's true some other things
27:46
like that the things that individuals
27:48
can do but also individuals can hold
27:50
governments and companies accountable so
27:54
you can protest you couldn't take up
27:55
every now and again we have to do this
27:57
folks every nothing you have to get up
27:59
get the broomstick take the broom off of
28:01
it you have to go get a piece of
28:03
cardboard and you have to touch it to
28:04
the room and you have to write on it
28:06
it's good to write on both sides and so
28:09
different things on both sides you can
28:11
make some jokes but then you put your
28:12
message and you go down to the town
28:14
square and you Pro and you March
28:16
you have to March for science so you
28:18
have to March for neutrality or
28:20
something old everyday or you have to
28:22
march against government spying you have
28:25
to march against firewalls and blocking
28:29
and censorship and so on so governments
28:32
sometimes get it go astray sometimes
28:35
governments don't do what they do and
28:37
they're responsible citizens so
28:41
sometimes we have to do that sometimes
28:43
we have to just protest sometimes we
28:46
have to protest companies sometimes you
28:47
have to bike or boycott companies
28:49
because they
28:50
have decided they decided that the
28:52
business interest will be will be better
28:57
served by breaking some fundamental
29:00
rules something like net neutrality or
29:02
they built something which has
29:03
discriminates against women or they
29:05
built something which discriminates by
29:07
race or something and so when you see
29:10
that it's partly knowing that you guys
29:12
are all going to protest and drop the
29:14
product keeps companies on on the strain
29:17
now so if if you go to contract for them
29:20
to web foundation.org sash for the web
29:26
then I don't well foundation you've got
29:33
it web foundations on web foundation
29:37
dollar org slash for the web and then so
29:45
click on the poster window well
29:48
afterwards so hashtag for the web so the
29:56
so that's getting involved in that the
30:00
the content for the web business things
30:02
well written it's the thing that's going
30:03
to be discussed from now until into
30:07
April so do get involved in those
30:09
discussions start discussions near you
30:11
have sort of contractor the web tracks
30:14
in your conferences and so on but these
30:17
things are the the these things that are
30:22
sometimes boring sometimes important but
30:24
if you if you spend ninety eight percent
30:31
of your time using the web and they're
30:34
only taking the infrastructure for
30:36
granted then two percent of your time
30:38
you should spend looking after it
30:40
making sure fighting for it so the
30:44
contract for the web was the way to do
30:45
it so I said I'd I'd look back and I
30:49
look at the current state and I look
30:51
forward in a way the the contract for
30:56
the web is about it's about positive
30:58
moves to go forward it's about in
31:01
reaction to the current state there's
31:03
also
31:04
I've personally been involved for a
31:07
while and technology the technology I
31:10
tend to use myself has tended to be
31:13
different from the way most people
31:15
design apps a little group of us would
31:18
be working at MIT in a project called
31:20
solid which where we instead of building
31:25
web apps where with a normal normal
31:29
where you build a web app use the user
31:31
interface and you'll build the back end
31:33
user interface runs code that runs in
31:35
the browser and the backend grounds Tim
31:38
you know typically JavaScript and PHP it
31:41
used to be you couldn't use all kinds of
31:42
things on the server now but typically
31:46
anytime if when you made whatever it is
31:49
you made a little app for figuring out
31:51
when can we all meet together for
31:53
example you make this a have for when
31:55
could we all meet together and you get
31:57
when can we or me together calm like
31:59
doodles or calm or something and and
32:01
doodle calm has got the a bunch of
32:06
JavaScript and it's got a bunch of PHP
32:08
and every time the idea about a schedule
32:10
changes every time the data model
32:12
changes every time this somebody needs a
32:14
new function out little a new function
32:16
then that means the schema of the
32:19
database has to change and the API has
32:21
to change and the code of the front-end
32:24
change all that changes together you're
32:26
trying to release it all together and
32:28
you have to convert if you if it's a
32:31
product you have to convert the old data
32:32
instant you and well that's one way of
32:35
doing it and what we've done with
32:36
Saunders was actually there will be no
32:39
back-end programming actually there is
32:41
lots of if you're back in programmer do
32:42
not object I hope people get obsessive
32:44
that point there will be plenty of
32:46
working programming but you but when
32:48
you're back programming the backend you
32:49
program these generic back-end you take
32:52
all your favorite systems your favorite
32:54
builds on top of a science server no
32:57
solace ever has just got one epi
32:59
it doesn't have a Twitter API and a
33:00
Facebook API and a strawberry API and a
33:03
doodle chrome API and a github API it
33:06
just said one API because that API
33:08
allows an app to write and to run any to
33:13
write ie structures of data
33:17
once it sells it rights is a the solid
33:22
world is a read write web world its
33:25
world in which you can treat the web as
33:29
though it was a disk you can put
33:32
photographs in it you can create a
33:34
folder you can put photographs in the
33:36
folder and then when you want to track
33:38
what the user chooses to make a photo
33:41
album out of then you put a data file in
33:43
the web and the data file sits there
33:45
back and it's at one time a fire but
33:48
it's also a database so the way
33:49
SolidWorks says that as so many changes
33:51
as they go down starring things because
33:54
they go down changing the order of
33:55
things in their foot in their photo
33:57
album you're dragging around things on
33:59
the screen you're just sending commands
34:01
fast
34:02
they're called HTTP patches if you want
34:05
down to and we'll talk about this more
34:07
more detail tomorrow but basically what
34:09
happens is that the app uses the fact
34:15
that the solid platform is just this big
34:17
sink of structured data the the solid
34:21
solid server doesn't care what app is
34:24
running all it does is is that you store
34:27
the structured data there's two things
34:29
it has you still starts the data and it
34:33
does access control so solid is about
34:37
looking at the world differently it's
34:40
about working at the world in which
34:41
you're very enabled the solid idea is
34:45
that you should control all your data
34:50
you should have complete control of your
34:52
data so we say okay solid apps will
34:55
store the data in when they start they
34:57
will ask you where didn't when it stole
34:58
the data you want to take some
34:59
photographs Dan you say okay this is a
35:02
work and do this work so I'll store it
35:04
in the work hard we call it a par is
35:07
where you store your data I have a work
35:08
part and a home part and I may have a
35:10
couple of other parts I may have things
35:12
to do with different well different jobs
35:15
I work and different companies them
35:17
involved in different I have may have
35:20
one when I share with the family but I
35:22
say if you like it's having disks in the
35:24
cloud you can think of them as they're
35:26
there you think of those personal data
35:29
stores you can think of them
35:31
like a thumb drive in the cloud but it's
35:33
your personal cloud you guys I actually
35:36
I have mine running at home so a lot of
35:38
the a lot of the people so I fired fired
35:41
up a solid server and I've had one
35:43
running it home for years so I've got
35:45
but one that's the way I work I I just
35:49
like to have my own system that I can
35:50
reboot and I run a solid software on it
35:53
so you can go out and so if say the
35:56
solid system is at is that if you're a
35:59
user you probably should wait until next
36:01
year because it's a bit rough around the
36:04
edges if you're a developer these some
36:06
helpers make it less rough around here
36:09
just please help us make the server we
36:11
have our server which is written in node
36:12
called and which is an NPN node server
36:16
and notes on the server and we have a
36:21
and we have a bunch of apps which were
36:23
playing with the main thing is to get
36:24
the server very robust and so these are
36:30
exciting times that I again I feel we
36:33
need to do a little bit of technology we
36:34
have a move on we to get people using
36:36
the web again whoever's in this we need
36:38
a mid-course correction here the solid
36:39
project is okay let's reboot it in a way
36:42
that people have control of their data
36:43
that it's again decentralized we have
36:46
people weather wherever their websites
36:49
are people have you know people again
36:51
can't blog they can construct things
36:53
they can link to things it's not just
36:54
about blogs is there all kinds of apps
36:56
all your favorite apps you can port to
36:59
solid so that they run you'll find when
37:02
they run in solid world its world of
37:03
linked data so because all of these pods
37:06
all of any objects in these pods have a
37:09
URL and they can link to any other URL
37:11
and so that the things you build can run
37:15
over all of the data which you access to
37:17
and all the data you have that your
37:18
friends have given you access to all the
37:20
public data as well and so you will be
37:24
building things structures which might
37:25
end up quite small and might end up
37:27
actually becoming indirectly quite big
37:29
and complicated and might end up
37:32
revealing new insights because you will
37:36
be able to capture relationships between
37:38
things like being if the original web
37:41
had been like it was designed to be
37:43
originally
37:44
and I make their next machine the
37:45
original web was you could make you
37:47
could just make a link from one place to
37:49
another just by him and control him
37:52
control L can work come on SC you
37:56
everything back and you could make links
37:59
in a way writing apps using solid is a
38:02
bit like that you can make links between
38:03
anything you can make reference to a
38:07
person or an event someone which is
38:09
anywhere else on though on the web so
38:14
it's exciting times it's sad times for
38:17
me I've taken a sabbatical from MIT so
38:20
I'm well I'm so I've got a start-up in
38:26
Boston I haven't worked for start-up
38:29
since early 1980s so it's great to be
38:37
back in an environment where we can we
38:40
have some because so it's a project but
38:43
the project is ridiculously huge so we
38:45
can do no interrupt dot-com I and our
38:50
UPT comm sorry it's for innovation
38:55
interruption okay and it's not very long
38:57
and it was available as a domain name
39:00
okay so that's what it is interrupt Joe
39:02
calm and that's and that's the start of
39:05
the startup obviously can't do solid all
39:07
it can do is put its best efforts into
39:10
trying to figure out what needs to be
39:11
done do we need to write tutorials do we
39:13
need to write developer frameworks to
39:17
help people using react or using view to
39:19
use solid do we need to port help people
39:22
portal thing from node to go to
39:26
different systems well it's so much
39:28
stuff to do so in so what interrupt is a
39:30
company will do maybe a bit like
39:32
Netscape back in the day well we will
39:34
make sure that stuff gets done we will
39:37
assume that most of it will get picked
39:39
up by other people we will download down
39:41
on the road pick up some commercial
39:44
products maybe you'll have some
39:47
particularly some others some enterprise
39:50
products will be will come out of that
39:52
out of the interrupt system okay
39:57
but it's the main thing is the solid
40:02
movement and actually it has you should
40:05
own your own data when you if you start
40:09
if you start with a concept that you
40:12
should own your own data then look at
40:14
the technology that the we put together
40:19
and look at the implications of just one
40:21
big API it's a paradigm shift I mean
40:24
it's all using the web technology right
40:25
there's all these t2b gets and HTV puts
40:28
but the way use it by having only one
40:29
API is very different and so the and so
40:37
it's exciting maybe it won't work
40:40
because people find it just too
40:43
difficult to wrap their heads around it
40:44
but I do invite you particularly as
40:48
developers you can do come and get
40:50
involved
40:52
teach each other about how it works help
40:54
us write documentation help us write
40:56
code and help us build a new world which
40:59
is respects people which is
41:01
decentralized like the web was where
41:04
individual creativity in innovation
41:09
individual creativity can if you like
41:13
group creativity as well that's what I
41:15
wanted so we can end up leveraging
41:18
working together to be able to solve
41:19
these huge problems out there and way
41:23
maybe we will also build systems to run
41:25
on top of solids which are great for
41:27
democracy and great for science as well
41:30
who knows but if you don't try you don't
41:34
succeed Thanks
41:46
thank you so much really heavy chairs
41:58
yeah okay thank you so much for that for
42:01
the talk I love these presentations
42:04
where you can put your history more in
42:07
place on events from the past so I read
42:12
actually somewhere recently because I
42:14
was researching a lot about what you are
42:16
doing and that if you had developed the
42:20
system for monetizing domain names and
42:23
you had charged a few dollars per domain
42:26
name you would have been a trillionaire
42:28
today is not so much a question but it's
42:32
just have you ever like imagined how big
42:36
a success you are how big a success your
42:40
invention eventually became yeah so I
42:44
don't know well fortunately or
42:45
unfortunately so it turns out that the
42:49
web taking off was not obvious there
42:52
were plenty of techni so it depending
42:53
other competing technologies and so and
42:56
in fact one of the criteria I said it
42:59
had to be universal in a way being
43:02
universal everybody has got to be able
43:04
to build a server everybody has you
43:06
can't ask that ask that everybody uses
43:08
your weird HTTP system and also after
43:11
them to give you ten cents they will
43:13
immediately go out make their own
43:14
proprietary systems in which will be
43:16
incompatible and the incompatible
43:18
systems will be just like the you know
43:20
and just like this is usual that
43:22
wouldn't have you wouldn't have be able
43:24
to link to everything the web wouldn't
43:25
have worked if it have not been free
43:27
sorry I fully understand but it's a nice
43:32
thought experiment
43:34
I guess Diana if you've made gazillions
43:37
of dollars out of the air of the web you
43:39
just said yes your checks are all
43:41
appreciated
43:44
okay so the Janna she is actually
43:46
running our go to Berlin conference and
43:50
so it's also thank you so you have a few
43:56
questions from the audience I have a few
43:57
questions from the audience that's right
43:59
and as I did before I will either read
44:02
or rephrase them so what do you think
44:06
would have been different if you would
44:08
have not started with CERN but with a
44:12
private company well sir I think I would
44:18
have worked a few private companies I
44:20
worked at plessy telecommunications
44:22
which was a big one and I would add and
44:27
I worked a couple of startups building
44:30
smart fences and that was it was really
44:33
exciting fun because of the new
44:38
technology but I wouldn't have had but
44:42
in a way CERN was this great petri dish
44:45
it was like a patriot a gar there was a
44:49
combination of things
44:51
at CERN which I think wouldn't which was
44:54
really valuable for start anywhere and
44:57
what do you think would have changed for
44:59
the web I wouldn't have invented it so
45:04
there you have it I wouldn't have I
45:05
wouldn't have been my center wouldn't
45:07
have been able to give me a bunch of
45:09
months to to just buy a next computer
45:12
because it seems like a good idea
45:13
I wouldn't he wouldn't have done that
45:16
because he wouldn't have heard me go on
45:19
and on about it at all these coffees at
45:21
all these drinks we wouldn't have been I
45:25
would have been sitting or in some
45:27
little company instead of sitting out
45:29
the certain cafeteria and which was
45:31
total tellers at the time you know with
45:33
the views of the mountains where and the
45:35
the the the this very much a spirit we
45:40
know but we certainly told to do more
45:43
with less because where's the funding
45:45
gets cut but you still have to make a
45:46
huge you know so being be inventive and
45:49
the people around me or wacky lot of
45:53
them physicists a lot of wood a lot of
45:55
very very creative
45:57
I think in a way lots of ways in which
45:59
certainly was a very valuable places and
46:02
perhaps unique I wanna I want to have a
46:07
follow-up question to that because it
46:09
fits do you ever regret creating the web
46:13
no good there's a long question there's
46:19
a long answer will do this f the short
46:21
on so I'll give you the long I won't
46:22
give you that on that's it okay so a
46:25
little bit follow up on that because in
46:27
your in your talk you said there is also
46:30
a lot of bad stuff on the web and there
46:33
was these fake news and how to print
46:35
guns and whatever there is there and so
46:39
there are companies like like Apple for
46:42
instance with the app store that kind of
46:44
restrict a lot what you can actually
46:46
publish with there within their app
46:49
store what do you think about that way
46:51
of controlling what goes to normal
46:54
consumers I think that as long as yeah
46:58
in a way a lot of things on the web
47:01
which over like for clubs which you can
47:04
join or not join so so long as it is so
47:08
once you have a choice that you can
47:09
decide okay I'm going to be given by a
47:11
closed system because life is too short
47:13
for me to be constantly being attacked I
47:16
want to buy I want to buy a system which
47:18
is locked down controlled by somebody
47:19
else like I had you know maybe a or but
47:26
as long as I have a choice so always
47:27
have a choice or you know I want to be
47:29
able but always themselves a choice to
47:32
be able to buy a system whether it's a
47:34
phone or a laptop where I have root
47:37
access where I can control everything
47:39
where I can store whatever I want I
47:41
think that's often sort of among the
47:43
fundamental it's not the right to have
47:45
root access on your computer isn't up
47:46
there and the human rights but when but
47:50
I think if people could have like very
47:52
upset when they were they protesting
47:53
about closed platform so I know I think
47:57
for example with the solid world I think
48:00
there will be your be able to install
48:02
and use any solid apps you like but
48:04
maybe one of the things we can do within
48:06
routes is to say there will be some
48:08
earth where there will be no effort
48:11
there will be no monetization of data
48:13
the app will be programmed just to do
48:17
what the user wants to do not to
48:19
distract them and the developers will
48:22
join a club of the beneficent app cub
48:26
and they will be benefits and a per
48:29
developers and so well we could have a
48:31
beneficent app store where everything
48:33
that's in it is is has been in your past
48:40
this is huge high bar that has been
48:42
developed it's not it doesn't mislead
48:45
doesn't trick the user and so I think
48:47
that would that'll be valuable in the
48:49
way I might want if I won't give my kids
48:51
a computer I might tell them because I'm
48:54
computer where I've locked it down to
48:56
say you can only use benefits and apps
48:57
because otherwise it's too dangerous out
48:59
there and as you get older then I'll
49:01
give you can download everything but but
49:04
when you can explain to me the
49:06
difference between you can show me how
49:07
to find out whether what or if you could
49:10
show me how you know how to run
49:13
Wireshark on your computer and find out
49:15
where the where the where it says it
49:18
will and well your apps are actually
49:22
contacting then sure then you can
49:24
install everything but so I think Carla
49:28
people gotta be able to have huge choice
49:31
and that choice has got to be you gotta
49:34
be able to be able to choose something
49:36
protected if you want a solid the next
49:42
step for revolutionizing the web as we
49:44
know it and what do you think are the
49:46
main challenges
49:50
I mean solids deals with a large chunk
49:54
of a solid producing system where the
49:57
personal data and also a lot of the
49:59
collaborative data and so we should be
50:00
able to build a lot of collaborative
50:02
platforms on top of solid maybe we will
50:04
end up also building publication
50:06
platforms maybe build end up building
50:07
newspapers and stuff on on top of solid
50:09
in fact as well so yeah but solid in
50:13
fact and having so the challenges
50:23
one of them is we have to get everybody
50:26
to adopt a single a system where
50:29
everybody has a URL which identifies
50:31
someone you have several different ones
50:32
they can some of them could be secret
50:34
but you have URL which identifies them
50:35
you have to have a way of authentication
50:37
to do that so we're moment we're using
50:39
oh I D connect YDC the which is sort of
50:43
based on that or we've got we've used
50:46
others we've used certificate based
50:49
public key systems before that one of
50:53
the challenges is finding a secure or
50:57
authentication server where you will
50:59
will use I've I think that's in a way
51:03
when we've done that then you'll be able
51:04
to log in with you know we love in with
51:06
F log in with G log in with s you know
51:11
that's sort in a way that the first
51:13
challenge is to get that done then the
51:15
next a huge challenge is that whenever
51:18
even though the solid even though you've
51:20
got all the solid servers are completely
51:22
meet the solidus back but if the
51:25
challenge is the app what I call the
51:28
client client specs the fact that all
51:30
the apps have to write data in the same
51:32
format getting everybody we've already
51:34
defined this is if you write contacts
51:37
information in so we have to get then
51:40
that's relatively straightforward but
51:43
because people there's a lot of Interop
51:47
about content text for every domain we
51:50
have to make standards and so the people
51:51
working on for example fitness all the
51:53
people doing fitness apps fitness
51:55
machines have to get together it may be
51:59
that some of the standards will just
52:00
they've already got them will they
52:02
already go for no garment they already
52:04
use garment for fitness or something
52:06
like that but all getting orders
52:09
together is submit that when you look at
52:10
the work that schema.org did there those
52:13
folks they put together a big huge
52:16
amount of standardization they did it
52:18
kind of quietly in the back end up
52:19
getting a lot of people getting excited
52:21
we have to do go with maybe we may use
52:25
that but getting getting getting all the
52:27
app developers to degree on the same
52:29
format so I think it's that's always a
52:32
big challenge
52:35
thank you
52:36
maybe one final little thing so have so
52:42
I mean you could either go maybe
52:46
starting in the public space in
52:48
government and start with with the
52:50
information that are in health care or
52:52
something oh you could or you could call
52:56
Mark Zuckerberg and say why don't we
52:59
start with you and Facebook you know
53:01
what what do you think is is that
53:04
something you have considered where it
53:05
will have traction first what we have to
53:08
Google about hosting pods we are and
53:11
that's very logical if they you know
53:13
they have g-drive for example I've got a
53:16
cool way I really need to talk to the
53:18
Dropbox people because if in a way
53:20
Dropbox terms and conditions are just
53:22
the sort of thing you'd expect from a
53:23
pod provider they'd have to put the
53:26
solid API on the all the things like
53:30
Dropbox and box dotnet and netbooks and
53:32
things or all those are all they're very
53:37
early adopters they're they're sort of
53:40
slam-dunk they should be adopting solid
53:42
then different apps I think it may be
53:45
that when you look at a social network
53:46
like Facebook they may decide clearly
53:50
destroying all the data has just gotten
53:53
just got us into trouble and and got
53:56
more and more complicated because if we
53:58
try to be all the apps to all the people
54:00
then it's we can't really do that but
54:03
what we would do want to be we want to
54:05
be the page that somebody's looking at
54:07
we want to be the app that somebody's
54:08
looking at so we will be trying to be
54:10
the big the Omega app we will be the app
54:13
which controls all the apps will be we
54:15
will be your control panel and your dock
54:18
and your desktop for all your solid
54:22
stuff and we'll give you access to over
54:24
solid staff and will be the place where
54:25
all your solid apps to plug in but we'd
54:28
like you to start off with us because we
54:31
want you to be sitting looking at us for
54:33
example that so lots of different ways
54:35
in which things should go in and it may
54:37
be that it may be that one particular
54:41
domain like fitness say we may get a
54:44
bunch of fitness creep you maybe you're
54:45
out here now
54:47
today they'll be four people in the
54:50
audience is fighting I've wanted all
54:52
I've always wanted to do the fitness app
54:54
thing and now I realize if I do it as a
54:57
followed app that would be it could
54:59
actually connect all the Fitness things
55:00
together and so we may get funded with
55:03
some particular vertical which ended up
55:05
being the early adopter space yeah so
55:09
last week I created a pot I went to
55:12
interrupt and and it's hosted at solid
55:15
so maybe until tomorrow you can all give
55:18
it a go and for those who go to the talk
55:21
and we can start playing with that
55:24
there's two providers a moment well
55:27
there's a few out there now but we're
55:28
one of them is one of the ones which
55:29
interrupts run says interrupt donut and
55:32
solid dot community and so those are
55:36
both one by interrupts and the various
55:39
other ones which are turning up as we
55:44
speak so by the time you get there there
55:45
may be other there may be other ones in
55:49
the lists but yes if you do and realize
55:53
that it is rough around the edges that
55:55
so what the way to if you get to if you
55:57
go to your public folder then and you
56:00
can try you can create new folders you
56:02
can create a few like I would put create
56:04
some folders for the date for the year
56:05
for the for the month from then within
56:07
that you can create things like meetings
56:09
and chats and things and so play if you
56:14
play with a chat what we've done in when
56:20
we've given talks to small numbers of
56:22
people then we've said everybody in the
56:24
room go to join the same chat put the
56:27
share amongst yourselves that's the URL
56:30
of the chat that somebody's made making
56:31
sure it's open to poke give it public
56:34
air read access public write access if
56:36
you want anybody to be able to join and
56:37
then when you go into the chat then you
56:40
can you'll see all the people who've
56:42
that you told about the chat in the chat
56:44
and their web ID their solid ID will be
56:47
available to you and then do things for
56:49
them because if you drag their name out
56:51
of the chat you can free example driver
56:53
into your list of we're done before is
56:57
now you go to the profile agency you can
57:00
find it so you can you can create a
57:02
social network out of the people in the
57:04
in the chat so we've done that within
57:06
sort of the time I'm not going to do
57:08
that tomorrow I'm just gonna give a talk
57:10
tomorrow I think even though you might
57:13
have great Wi-Fi also it would be it
57:16
would be reminding a lot of the Wi-Fi
57:17
gods and there's a tenant demo gods but
57:20
that's the sort of thing wishes happened
57:22
and the get a chat is where we do we
57:27
thank you so much let's all give a hand
57:30
to a certain mercy
57:31
[Applause]
