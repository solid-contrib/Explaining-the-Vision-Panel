This is a brain dump of idea for a video to tell the [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel/blob/master/Nutshell/Solid-in-a-nutshell.md) story. 





Tell the story from the perspective of a relatable human day-to-day experience. 

Make sure to include the key points of [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel/blob/master/Nutshell/Solid-in-a-nutshell.md)

For example, the mad variety of chat apps to describe non-interoperability:
Switch between scenes of people trying to communicate with each other from lots of different perspectives... 
* A person on a dating app gets asked, do you have instagram? No, but I have whatsapp? And signal? 
* A parent with multiple kids who all use a different chat app and has a whole folder of them on their phone and can't keep track. 
* Two friends who text each other on imessage, respond on whatsapp, return to signal, send a random happy birthday message on linkedin, switch to instagram messaenger, and then over to facebook messager for the birthday event (which gets emailed). 
* a grandfather who insists on text messages and faxing with a grandaughter trying to work out how to fax and in shock when a text arrives or doesn't even notice the email come through, responding on snapchat but grandpa doesn't realise the snapchat coming through. 
* A developer with a fantastic new idea (snapchat) who has to convince everyone to switch over to their app (along with the business) 
* A government who is trying to reach it's citizens without dependency on non-publicly controlled communication channels 
In a solid world... 
transfer to the world where everyone can pick and choose and still reach each other. 

Another idea...
Get across the unease and irritation of terms and conditions. Switch to a world where you hear a story about a data scandal and can switch Pod, app, or identity provider. 

Need a graphic explaining the idea of the standard: 
* separate the data from the app while having agreement on how the data should be structured so it can slot in and out of a variety of solutions. 

* Pod: description of 'in Solid where you store your data is called a Pod'. Although data seems like magical fairy dust floating through the ether it's actually attached to hard wires, databases and physical machinery. In Solid, where you store your data is called a Pod.  You can have multiple Pods, but all your apps are able to connect to all your Pods. 
* Like peas in a Pod. 
* Open the Pod bay door, hal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSIKBliboIo 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POD 
* granny pod: "A small house on one's property, separate from the main house, that serves as a permanent home for one's aging parents. Also called a "granny pad." With this granny pod, I get to see my family all the time, while still having a place of my own that is easy to maintain. Just don't call me "Granny"!"

Tell the story from the perspective of data as if it were alive?
